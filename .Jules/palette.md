## 2024-05-23 - [CLI Semantic Coloring]
**Learning:** CLI tools benefit significantly from semantic color wrappers (Success/Error/Warning) rather than raw color codes. Progressive enhancement with `try-except` for dependencies like `termcolor` ensures robustness across environments.
**Action:** Use `mekhane/anamnesis/ux_utils.py` for all future CLI output to maintain consistency and accessibility.
