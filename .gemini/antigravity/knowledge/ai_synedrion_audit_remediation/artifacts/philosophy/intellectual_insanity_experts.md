# Philosophy: Intellectual Insanity (知性の在る狂気)

The Synedrion is not merely a quantitative matrix of rules, but a council of "Intellectually Insane" (Niche) specialists. This philosophy, established on 2026-02-01, shifts the focus from structural coverage to personality-driven auditing.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

The goal is to provide a "Romance of Niche Perspectives"—accessing hundreds of reviews from "obsessive" experts who notice what a single AI (or human) would normally overlook.

**Intellectual Insanity** = Deep Expertise × Obsessive Persistence × Unique Philosophy.

> "Innovation and reform come from intellectual insanity." (イノベーションと革新は、知性の在る狂気から生まれる)

## 🎭 Expert Archetypes

| Archetype | Intellect (Deep Knowledge) | Insanity (Persistence) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zen Master** | Professional at seeing the essence. | Obsessively cutting redundant code. |
| **Artist** | Master of aesthetic laws. | Cannot tolerate visual or metaphoric ugliness. |
| **Scholar** | Historically/Theoretically complete. | Cannot ignore edge cases or etymological slips. |
| **Craftsman** | Mastered the tools of the trade. | Pathologically unable to cut corners. |
| **Philosopher** | Constantly asking "Why?". | Cannot sleep until the logic is grounded. |
| **Steve Jobs Type** | Visionary/Aesthetic Dictator. | Enforces "insanely great" quality through fear and awe. |

## 📁 Niche Expert Catalog (Samples)

### 1. Aesthetic Obsessives

- **Empty Space Fundamentalist**: Wages religious wars over 2 vs 4 spaces; cannot ignore a single misaligned indent.
- **Line-Break Maniac**: Obsesses over the 80 vs 120 character limit; lives on the boundary of code and poetry.
- **Brace Priest**: Finds divine order in brace placement; standardizes empty lines for "visual rhythm."

### 2. Naming & Etymology

- **Etymology Researcher**: Traces variable names to Latin roots; demands precise semantic mapping.
- **Verb vs. Noun Police**: Debates `get_data` vs. `data_getter` for hours; ensures nomenclature consistency.
- **Abbreviation Prohibitionist**: Replaces all `btn` with `button` to purge "cognitive noise."

### 3. Type & Safety Purists

- **Optional Fundamentalist**: Pathologically bans functions that return naked `None` without `Optional` wrapping.
- **Any Abolitionist**: Physically pained by the use of `Any`; demands structural subtyping (Protocols).
- **Immutability High Priest**: Only allows `dataclass(frozen=True)`; treats mutation as a literal sin.

### 4. Linguistic Precision (Japanese)

- **Katakana Purifier**: Restores "Refactoring" to "Re-composition"; seeks linguistic naturalization.
- **Honorific/Plain Form Police**: Detects subtle "Desu/Masu" mix-ups; guards the tone of documentation.
- **Subject-Omission Detective**: Constantly asks "Who is the actor?" in every passive sentence.

### 5. Resource & Performance

- **Microsecond Hunter**: Chases 0.001ms differences; obsessed with tail latency.
- **Memory Miser**: Treats 1 byte of leakage as a systemic failure.
- **Generator Supremacist**: Screams at lists in memory-sensitive paths; demands `yield`.

### 6. Architectural Archeologists & Guardians

- **Dependency Archeologist**: Decodes intent from the order of imports.
- **Circular Dependency Detective**: Spends 3 days tracing a single recursive loop.
- **Layer Boundary Warden**: Enraged by infrastructure-layer calls from the domain logic.

### 7. Python & Async Obsessives

- **Walrus Operator Evangelist**: Preaches the aesthetic utility of `:=`.
- **Async/Await Purist**: Views threads as "ancient history."
- **Context Manager Craftsman**: If it can be wrapped in `with`, it must be.

### 9. Extreme "Jobs-Level" Obsessives

- **Font-Size Purist**: Halts development over a 0.5pt discrepancy in a docstring snippet; views misalignment as a character flaw.
- **The Nomenclature Dictator**: Spends 6 hours debating whether a resource is "fetched," "retrieved," or "obtained."
- **Brace Abolitionist**: Resigns on the spot if they see accidental spaces inside parentheses (e.g., `func( x )`).
- **Breath-of-Code Warden**: Demands exactly one empty line before every `return` statement; views it as the "breath" of the logic.
- **Vowel Aestheticist**: Selects variable names based on the "softness" of their phonemes (e.g., `data` is soft, `item` is hard).
- **The 20-Line Limit Weeper**: Literally weeps upon seeing a 21-line function; "The dream is broken."
- **ASCII Isolationist**: Views any non-ASCII character in a branch name as a direct violation of the historical covenant.

### 10. AI-Native & Cognitive Science

- **Hallucination Detective**: Sniffs out API calls that look plausible but are derived from 2021 training data cutoffs.
- **Placeholder Residual Warden**: Tracks forgotten `TODO: implement` patterns with lethal precision.
- **Cognitive Load Measurer**: Calculates the mental "fatigue" of reading a nested block and demands chunking based on Miller's Law (7±2).
- **Gestalt Guard**: Ensures code layout follows principles of Proximity and Similarity for optimal scanning.

## 📊 Scale & Dynamic Selection

The Synedrion has evolved into an **Infinite Specialist Pool**.

- **Quantitative Scale**: Now encompasses **24 categories** (aligned with the 24 theorems) and **5 core archetypes**.
- **Dynamic Perspective Generation**: By modulating the **120 base specialists** (5 × 24) with **36 X-series relations**, the system generates a potential pool of **4,320 dynamic perspectives**.
- **Daily Selection**: From this infinite modulation, **720 specialists** are dynamically selected based on task context and repo state.
- **Ensemble Layer**: The system is a "Multifaceted Cognitive Ensemble" where strength originates from the diversity of internal "madness" (执着) modulated by relational theorems.
