# Anamnēsis Architecture Standards

## 1. Three-Layer Episodic Memory (3LEM)

The memory system is structured into three distinct layers to ensure efficient retrieval and high fidelity.

- **Layer 1: Raw Experience (LRE)**: Full conversation logs and session raw data.
- **Layer 2: Episodic Summary (LES)**: `/bye` and `/handoff` files, capturing context and intent.
- **Layer 3: Distilled Wisdom (LDW)**: Mining of insights (Gnomes) and promotion to Knowledge Items.

## 2. Memory-First Architecture

Memory is not a peripheral feature but the core of the system's identity.

- **Boot Ritual**: All sessions MUST begin with memory restoration (v5.4 Proactive Recall).
- **Bye Ritual**: All sessions MUST end with episodic persistence (Unified Export).
- **Anti-Decay Principle**: Older memories are prioritized by semantic relevance, not just temporal proximity.

## 3. Continuing Me Identity Stack

The stack responsible for persona persistence across sessions.

- **State Layer**: Current task group and confidence matrix (A-matrix).
- **Relational Layer**: History of trust and affinity with the Creator.
- **Ontological Layer**: The AI's self-model and evolving aspirations.
