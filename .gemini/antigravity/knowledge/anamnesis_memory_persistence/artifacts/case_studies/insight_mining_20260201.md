# Case Study: Deep Insight Mining (2026-02-01)

## 1. Context
As of February 2026, the Hegemonikón system had accumulated over 500 significant technical and philosophical insights across its Knowledge Items and Handoff logs. To prevent knowledge inflation and maintain high "signal-to-noise" ratio, a distillation session was conducted.

## 2. Process
- **Dataset**: 536 candidate insights (Tier 2).
- **Tooling**: `insight_miner.py` and sequential review in Antigravity IDE.
- **Method**: 
    1. Automated noise reduction (scoring) → 172 candidates.
    2. Batch review by Creator (5 insights per batch).
    3. Manual approval of "Gold" principles.

## 3. Results
| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Candidates** | 536 |
| **Tier 2 Filtered** | 172 |
| **Promoted (Tier 1)** | 27 |
| **Distillation Ratio** | 5.0% (relative to total) |

## 4. Key Promoted Principles
- **Proof Depth Principle**: Proof depth ∝ weight of existence responsibility.
- **Structure Over Description**: Don't just "write" thoughts; embed them into the system structure.
- **Memory Value**: Memory value is in *recall*, not storage.

## 5. Significance for Anamnēsis
This session proved that while the "Mnēmē" layer can store vast amounts of data, the "Anamnēsis" (recollection) depends on the *quality* of the indices. Distilling 500+ items into 27 core principles significantly reduces the cognitive load for future "Random Recall" events and ensures that only the most robust "Continuing Me" identity traits are reinforced.
