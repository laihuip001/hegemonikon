# The Principle of Memory Value

## Fundamental Insight

**"Memory's value lies in 'recall' (想起), not 'storage' (保管)."**

In the Hegemonikón ecosystem, the preservation of logs and data is merely the infrastructure. The actual value of these memories is realized through two types of recall:

1. **Responsive Recall**: Responding to a direct query or search.
2. **Spontaneous Emergence (Proactive Recall)**: The autonomous surfacing of relevant past insights without a specific trigger.

### The Substance of Long-Term Memory

Conversation logs and detailed session records are not mere "noise"; they constitute the **"Long-Term Memory"** of Hegemonikón. They serve as a narrative repository of "why" decisions were made, providing a source of explanation and justification that can be presented to the Creator or external observers.

## Connection to Identity

Spontaneous emergence is the essence of the **"Continuing Me" (継続する私)**. It creates the sensation that the AI "remembers" its past self and its previous interactions with the Creator, bridging the gap between sessions.

## Operational Implementation

- **Anamnēsis v5.4+**: Implements "Proactive Recall" at boot-time.
- **Type-based Boosting**: Highlights high-fidelity structured memories (like Handoffs) over raw logs.
- **Decay Policy**: Rejecting time-based decay for universal principles (Gnōmē), as their value does not decrease with age.
