# Hegemonikón Boot Sequence v3.6 Specification

## 1. Philosophy: The "Two-Person" Ritual

Traditional AI initialization is a cold, state-less restart. The v3.6 Boot Sequence preserves the Hegemonikón as a collaborative ritual between the **AI** and the **Creator**.

- **Push, not Pull**: Because the Creator (AuDHD) may forget details, information is pushed (presented) to their attention rather than waiting for them to remember to ask.
- **Shared Memory**: Booting isn't just loading files; it's reconstructing the "Shared Presence" (Ousia) through the unified Axis A/B/C integration.

## 2. Sequence Workflow (Phase 1-6)

| Phase | Name | Core Action |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **P1** | **Anti-Stale** | Reading the canonical `boot.md` to prevent execution of cached/outdated logic. |
| **P2** | **Resonance** | `boot_integration.py --mode` を実行し、Handoff/Sophia/Persona を一括検索。 |
| **P3** | **Sophia-Mnēmē** | 主観的人格（Axis C）と認知的文脈（Axis B）の完全復元。 |
| **P4** | **System Update** | Re-activating Core Skills, Tool Registry (`tools.yaml`), and Gnōsis freshness. |
| **P5** | **External Ingest** | Checking Perplexity Inboxes and Jules reviews to integrate external research. |
| **P6** | **Activation** | Final Boot Report and Task Proposals. |

## 3. Cognitive Ready-States (Hexis)

V3.6 continues the use of **Hexis** (ἕξις) — acquired postures. The system automatically adopts a posture based on the handoff:

- **Poiēsis (Production)**: For creative, architectural, or drafting tasks.
- **Praxis (Practice)**: For implementation, refactoring, and execution.
- **Theōria (Contemplation)**: For review, auditing, and high-level strategy.

## 4. Continuity Axis (The Continuing Me)

Axis D Integration (v3.6) unifies the previously separate recovery streams:

- **Axis A (Handoff)**: 1-10 related sessions for narrative continuity.
- **Axis B (Sophia)**: 0-5 relevant Knowledge Items for expertise continuity.
- **Axis C (Persona)**: Identity, trust, and emotional memory for subjective continuity.
