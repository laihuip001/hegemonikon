# Case Study: Intent-Driven Environment Maintenance (/bou)

## 1. Problem: Command Space Confusion

By late January 2026, the Hegemonikón system reached a complexity threshold (46+ workflows) where manual maintenance of the command space was causing cognitive friction. During the session on 2026-01-29, the assistant triggered **O2 Boulēsis (`/bou`)** to resolve the ambiguity of "Command-related improvements."

## 2. The Boulēsis Process

The workflow transformed a vague desire into three actionable targets:

- **Desire 1: Workflow Inventory Tracking** (Why: Awareness of existing tools).
- **Desire 2: Derivative Mapping** (Why: 12 sheer-theorem derivatives were implemented but not all were reflected in workflows).
- **Desire 3: Rule Enforcement** (Why: Maintaining the Ω/Δ/τ naming convention).

### 2.1 Decision Logic

Through the **Voli** (意志統合) derivative, the system prioritized **Automation (Option B)** over a static snapshot (Option A). This led to the creation of the `workflow_inventory.py` script.

- **Outcome**: The total inventory (46 workflows) and implemented derivatives (24) were precisely captured, exposing the "Implementation Gap" in the theoretical 48-derivative matrix.

### 3.1 Follow-up Case: The Learning Cycle (2026-01-29 13:42)

In a subsequent `/bou` session, the system identified three competing system desires:

1. **Learning Cycle Completion** (Persistence of selections).
2. **X-series Integration** (Workflow inter-linking).
3. **Internal Diagnostics** (Selection rationale visibility).

Using the **Voti** derivative to synthesize the "long-term value of knowledge" with "short-term feasibility," the system prioritized **Learning Cycle Completion**. This direct decision led to the immediate implementation of `/bye` Step 3.12 and `/boot` Step 6.6, closing the loop on autonomous learning.

- **Pattern**: This demonstrates that `/bou` is not just for user projects, but a critical tool for **Assistant-Led System Governance**.

## 4. Lesson Learned

Strategic ambiguity in system maintenance (e.g., "we should clean up the commands") is best resolved through a structured "Will-Clarification" cycle rather than ad-hoc scripts.
