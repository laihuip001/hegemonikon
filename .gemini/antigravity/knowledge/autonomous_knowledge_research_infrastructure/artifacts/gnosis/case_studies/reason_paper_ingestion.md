# Case Study: Ingesting "REASON" (2026-01-29)

The first real-world test of the automated Gnōsis Digestor pipeline was performed on the paper **"REASON: Accelerating Probabilistic Logical Reasoning for Scalable Neuro-Symbolic Intelligence"** (arXiv:2601.20784v1).

## 1. Selection & Scoring

- **Topics Matched**: `active-inference`, `metacognition`.
- **Score**: 0.43.

## 2. Ingestion Workflow (/eat)

Processed through the `/eat` workflow:

- **Phase 1 (Analysis)**: Identified neuro-symbolic and scalability components.
- **Phase 2 (Cooking)**: Attempted mapping to `/noe`, `/epi`, `/met`.

## 3. The "Abstraction Gap" Discovery

- **Depth vs. Height**: The paper provides a deep *algorithmic* implementation, but Hegemonikón operates at a *cognitive/philosophical* level.
- **Decision**: Classified as **🟡 Absorbed** rather than **🟢 Integrated** to prevent polluting high-level workflows with transient technical details.

## 4. Architectural Corrective

- **Macro Abstraction Filter**: Future versions of the Digestor will separate **Meta (Theoretical/Structural)** papers (candidates for /eat) from **Object (Implementation/Data)** papers (candidates for KI reference storage).
