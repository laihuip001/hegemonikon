# SEL Enforcement Standard (Agentic Zero-Trust)

## Overview

As part of the **Agentic Zero-Trust** protocol, the Semantic Enforcement Layer (SEL) is now mandatory for all workflows with a Complexity Point (CP) score above 30 or those utilizing intensity operators ($+$ or $!$).

## Rule: Mandatory Expansion

The agent MUST explicitly expand all CCL operators into their SEL natural language equivalents before proceeding to Phase 1 of any workflow. Failure to do so is classed as a structural integrity violation.

## SEL Thresholds

| Mission Criticality | Enforcement Level | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Low (CP < 15) | Implicit | Symbol recognition only. |
| Med (CP 15-30) | SEL Recommended | Explicit mention of SEL directive in Phase 0. |
| High (CP > 30) | **SEL Mandatory** | Full mapping table and "Commitment Report" required. |

## Verification Protocol

1. **Pre-flight**: Agent echoes the SEL directive.
2. **Mid-run**: Diorthōsis (Correction) checks for task-skipping.
3. **Post-run**: Self-audit confirms if execution met the SEL minimum requirements defined in the workflow's frontmatter.
