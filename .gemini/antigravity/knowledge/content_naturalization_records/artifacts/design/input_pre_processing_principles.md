# Input Pre-processing Design Principles

Derived from the "Flow AI" philosophy and the user's specific request for a "scribble-to-structure" workflow.

## 📜 The "Unified Core" Design Philosophy

1. **下処理の美学 (Aesthetics of Pre-processing)**:
   - Focus on material preparation, not final completion.
   - Do not over-process; preserve the "scribble" intent while removing noise.
2. **非破壊的介入 (Non-invasive Intervention)**:
   - Do not overwrite the user's "voice" or the base model's "personality".
   - Act as a translucent layer (an "incubator") that helps ideas settle.
3. **ゼロ・フリクション (Zero-Friction)**:
   - Optimized for "lazy" or "messy" inputs.
   - The cost of input must be minimized; the cognitive bridge is handled by the pre-processor.

## 🛠️ The "Scribble-Bridge" Workflow Pattern

This pattern addresses the gap between messiness (low effort) and high-quality AI output (high precision).

### Step 1: Noise Removal (Non-invasive)

Remove redundant fillers, spelling errors, and logical circularity without changing the core argument.

### Step 2: Intent Calibration (Intensity Spectrum)

Determine the "Pre-processing Intensity":

- **Low**: Just fix typos (Light).
- **High**: Reconstruct the logic based on context (Rich).

### Step 3: Priming (Dialectic Output)

Instead of just "better text", produce a "primed input" that is optimized for specific theorems (e.g., geared for `/noe` or `/ene`).
