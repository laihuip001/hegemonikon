# Module Digestion Strategy Refinement

> **Hegemonikón**: O1 Noēsis + /ax Analysis

This document records the strategic decision to shift the module naturalization process from a theorem-based sequential batch (O+A → P+H → K+S) to a **Hypervisor-Centric Architecture (G-Groups)**.

## 1. The Strategy Shift

### Thesis: Theorem-Based Grouping (Original Plan)

The initial idea was to group modules by their target Hegemonikón theorem (e.g., all O-series modules together).

- **Pros**: Clear target mapping.
- **Cons**: Fragmented logic (e.g., security modules split across batches), missing the "Hypervisor" orchestration context.

### Antithesis: G-Group Architecture (New Plan)

The revised strategy follows the **Cognitive Hypervisor's** own categorization (G-1 to G-5).

- **Pros**: High cohesion (related security/logic modules stay together), follows the original design intent (Constitutional Logic), and uses the Hypervisor as the first entry point to guide all subsequent mappings.
- **Cons**: Requires more complex cross-series mapping within a single batch.

### Synthesis: Hypervisor-First Naturalization

The final strategy, successfully implemented for Batches 0-2:

1. **Batch 0**: Ingest the **Hypervisor** itself into `/boot`. This establishes the "Stance" (Hexis) and "Correction" (Diorthōsis) mechanisms.
2. **Batches 1-5**: Ingest modules based on their **G-Group** identity (G-1 Iron Cage, G-2 Logic Gate, etc.).

## 2. Refined Batch Plan

| Batch | Target Group | Theme | Theorems |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **0** | Hypervisor | Constitutional Logic | `/boot`, S2/S4/A2 |
| **1** | G-1 Iron Cage | Boundary & Sanctuary | P1 Khōra (Horos) |
| **2** | G-2 Logic Gate | Quality & Syntax | S3 Stathmos (Metrika) |
| **3** | G-3 Shield | Resilience & Defense | H-Series, `/dia` |
| **4** | G-4 Lifecycle | Context & Continuity | K-Series |
| **5** | G-5 Meta-Cognition | Review & Evolution | `/pan`, `/boot` |

## 3. Key Principles for Digestion

1. **Constitutional Anchor**: The Hypervisor's "Butler Protocol" and "Modes" must exist *before* individual modules are integrated, as they provide the execution context.
2. **Boundary Priority**: Security and structural boundaries (G-1 Iron Cage) are naturalized next to protect the integrity of the framework during the rest of the ingestion process.
3. **Recursive Verification**: Each batch must achieve a "Naturalized" status (0 legacy boundaries detected) before proceeding to the next.

## 4. Post-Digestion Analysis (/dia+ /dia*)

The naturalization of the 25-module library was subjected to a deep quality audit, revealing significant architectural insights.

### Meta-Pattern: The Convergence Law

The process revealed a distinct law of cognitive compression during naturalization:

- **Input**: 25 Discrete Modules (Industrial/Siloed)
- **Output**: 6 Integrated Sections (Philosophical/Holistic)
- **Compression Rate**: **76%** (4.16 modules per protocol section)

**Finding**: Complexity is not eliminated but absorbed by rising in abstraction. The shift from "Module 04: TDD" to "S3 Stathmos: Metrika (Dokimē)" moves the focus from *procedure* to *standardized quality gate*.

### 10th Man Objection: Discoverability vs. Elegance

The Council of Critics identified a potential vulnerability in the consolidated architecture.

- **Vulnerability**: New users may struggle to find specific functionalities (e.g., "Where is TDD?") within the broad philosophical categories.
- **Mitigation**: Maintain `code-protocols/SKILL.md` as a legacy-to-naturalized mapping index to preserve the "search bridge."

### Deep Insight (/u+)

The transition from "DMZ Protocol" (Technical) to "Temenos" (Sanctuary/Philosophical) fundamentally alters the psychological weight of the constraint. Violating a "Sanctuary" carries more moral/architectural weight than a "Protocol Violation," thereby increasing compliance without increasing enforcement overhead.
