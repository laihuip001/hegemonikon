# Naturalization Protocol (@naturalize v2.0)

The `@naturalize` macro is the engine of the Hegemonikón digestive system. It ensures that any external item ("food") is recursively refined until it is fully green according to the dialectical diagnosis.

## Macro Definition

```ccl
@naturalize = F:{
  /eat{target=$item}                      # Initial Ingestion
  _
  @dia~{target=$item}                     # Dialectical Diagnosis (v2.0)
  _
  IF{result != green}:
    /mek+{enhance=$item}                  # Recursive Mechanic Reinforcement
    _
    @dia~{target=$item}                   # Re-evaluation
}[until:all_green]
```

## Dialectical Diagnosis (@dia~)

In v2.0, the simple `/fit+` diagnostic is replaced by a dialectical vibration:
`@dia~ = (/dia~/noe)~(\dia~/noe)`

- **Thesis (`/dia~/noe`)**: Searches for evidence that the item **is** correctly integrated.
- **Antithesis (`\dia~/noe`)**: Searches for evidence of "indigestion" or "leftovers"—where it **fails** or is superficial.
- **Synthesis (`~`)**: Resolves the conflict to reach a robust "Green" state.

## Naturalization States

The system tracks items through four levels of digestion:

1. **🔴 Superficial**: Registered only by name (Indigestion Risk: High).
2. **🟡 Indexed**: CCL signature assigned, categorical placement fixed.
3. **🟢 Absorbed**: Detailed procedures, triggers, and templates added (Tier 1 status).
4. **🟢🟢 Naturalized**: Fully integrated with theorem operators (`+`, `-`, `*`). Equivalent to a built-in axiom.

## Core Macros Integrated

- **@eat**: `/eat` (The start of the process)
- **@mek**: `/mek+` (The mechanism of improvement)
- **@fit**: Replaced by **@dia~** for higher rigor.
- **@pan**: Integrated within the `\dia` inverted perspective to find blind spots.

## Execution Record: Operation "Full Green" (2026-01-31)

- **Input**: `TIER2_LIBRARY.md` (237 items)
- **Protocol**: `@naturalize` v2.0 (Dialectical Diagnosis)
- **Outcome**: **All Green (100% Digest) ✅**
- **Action Taken**: 18 WF files updated with `derivatives:` and initial registration.

## Phase 2: True Naturalization (Procedural Hardening)

The milestone recognized that simple derivative registration is "Surface Naturalization" (Indexed+). True Naturalization requires:

1. **Deepening via `/mek+`**: Using the Mekhanē workflow to design the specific procedural steps for the mode.
2. **Parent Integration**: Adding a detailed `--mode=X` section to the parent workflow file.
3. **Standardized Output**: Ensuring the mode produces artifacts consistent with the Universal Artifact Generation Standard.

### Strategy Note: Steady Naturalization

Given the volume of the Tier 2 library (237 items), the system adopts a **"Steady Naturalization"** strategy—focusing on high-priority batches in each session rather than a single massive ingestion. This ensures each mode's procedural logic is architecturally sound and validated via `/mek+`.

### Phase 2 Execution Status (2026-01-31)

- **Batch 1**: Complete (8 modes: `pareto`, `optimize`, `safety`, `steelman`, `devil`, `counterfactual`, `mece`, `problem`).
- **Batch 2**: Complete (6 modes: `transfer`, `pattern`, `jtbd`, `utility`, `toc`, `leverage`).
- **Batch 3**: Complete (3 modes: `analogy`, `lit`, `metaphor` in `gno.md`).
- **S1 Metron**: Complete (`toc`, `fermi`).
- **Batch 4**: Complete (`search`, `backward` in `hod.md`; `desir`, `voli`, `akra` in `bou.md`).
- **Audit Methodology**: Mandatory `/mek+` retroactive audit completed for 29 mode sections.
