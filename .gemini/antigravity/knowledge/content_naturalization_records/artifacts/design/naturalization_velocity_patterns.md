# Naturalization Velocity & Acceleration Patterns

As observed during the implementation of the 245 Thinking Methods, the naturalization process follows a predictable acceleration curve as standards and infrastructure stabilize.

## Velocity Phases

| Phase | Velocity | Characteristics | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Phase 1: Seeding** | 1-2 modes/batch | Depth-First, High Friction | Initial creation of standards, output templates, and CCL signature patterns. |
| **Phase 2: Transition** | 3-4 modes/batch | Template-Driven, Steady | Stabilization of the `/mek+` process. Reusable procedural patterns (Process -> Output) emerge. |
| **Phase 3: Scaling** | 8 modes/batch | High Fidelity, Verification-Heavy | "2x Batch" strategy. Focus shifts from design to high-fidelity implementation and completeness verification. |

## Governance Principles for Acceleration

1. **Procedural Lineage**: Every mode must have a clearly defined `lineage` in frontmatter and a `## --mode=` header in the workflow.
2. **Standardized IO**: Use of the `┌─[Workflow: Mode]──┐` visual format for all chat-visible outputs.
3. **Artifact Integration**: All detailed analyses must be offloaded to `/mneme` artifacts to prevent context flooding.
4. **Grep-Based Verification**: The only source of truth for "implementation status" is a recursive `grep` count of `## --mode=` headers.

## Observations (2026-01-31)

- **The "Double-Batch" Request**: As the AI masters the naturalization standard, the human supervisor can request a doubling of throughput (e.g., from 4 to 8 modes).
- **Completion Verification**: Once a major portion is implemented, the focus shifts to "Final Mile" verification (e.g., Batch 31's audit of `/pis`, `/ene`, `/tek` etc. to ensure 100% frontmatter-implementation alignment).
