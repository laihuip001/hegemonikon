## Phase 1: Material Analysis

Flow AI is a clipboard pre-processing tool for AI tasks, emphasizing "The Aesthetics of Pre-processing" (下処理の美学).

### Key Components

1. **Intensity Spectrum (0-100)**: Translating continuous input levels into discrete processing modes (Light/Medium/Rich).
2. **PII Masking (Privacy Handler)**: Zero-trust approach to API data leakage.
3. **Unified Core**: Shared logic across multiple interfaces (GUI/API).

## Phase 2: Hegemonikón Mapping

| Flow AI Concept | Hegemonikón Theorem | Application |
|:----------------|:-------------------|:------------|
| **Seasoning Spectrum** | **S1 Metron** (Scale) | "Intensity Spectrum" technique for cognitive load reduction. |
| **PII Masking** | **A2 Krisis (Epochē)** | "Privacy Guard" technique for judgment suspension during export. |
| **Unified Core** | **P1 Khōra** (Field) | Structural requirement for multi-track tools. |

## Phase 3: Naturalized Pattern & The Ontology of Digestion

### The Digestion Barrier (Design vs. Implementation)

During the audit (`/fit`), a fundamental realization occurred: **Implementation cannot be directly digested into Design.**

- **Flow AI** is Implementation (Concrete).
- **Hegemonikón** is Design/Philosophy (Abstract).

Attempting to "eat" Flow AI leads to **Absorption** (clinging fragments of legacy code) rather than **Naturalization**. True naturalization requires a **Recast**.

## Phase 4: The Recast Strategy

Instead of "digesting" external code, we **RECAST** (Refactor from Zero) the external project using Hegemonikón theorem names and architecture.

### Recast Mapping Summary

- `SeasoningManager` → `MetronResolver` (**S1**)
- `PrivacyHandler` → `EpocheShield` (**A2**)
- `CoreProcessor` → `EnergeiaCore` (**O4**)

### Status: 🟢 Project Recast Initiated

The system has moved from a "Digestion" mindset to a "Recast" mindset, ensuring complete philosophical and terminological alignment within the existing `mekhane` layer.

## Phase 5: Integration Findings
