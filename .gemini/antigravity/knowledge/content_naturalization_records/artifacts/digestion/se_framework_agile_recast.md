## 1. Overview

This document records the naturalization of Software Engineering (SE) frameworks—specifically Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban—into the Hegemonikón theorem system.

The integration follows the **"Zero-Command Growth"** strategy: rather than creating new commands or CCL syntax for sprints and backlogs, the core philosophy of SE is injected into the operational logic of existing workflows (`/mek`, `/s`, `/dia`, `/gno`).

## 2. Philosophical Mapping

| Agile Concept | Hegemonikón Translation | Operational Insight |
|:--------------|:------------------------|:--------------------|
| **Product Owner** | **O2 Boulēsis** | The guardian of *Telos* (purpose) and value. |
| **Scrum Master** | **S2 Mekhanē** | The optimizer of *Schema* (workflow). |
| **Development Team**| **O4 Energeia** | The agent of *Praxis* (actualization). |
| **Sprint / Iteration**| **Oscillation ~()** | A repetitive cycle of strategy ↔ execution. |
| **Backlog** | **Mnēmē** | Persistent knowledge of intent and debt. |

## 3. Operational Principles (Internalization)

### 3.1 Fail Fast (Early Failure)

- **Workflow**: `/mek` Step 3 (Conflict).
- **Mandate**: Mandatory "Conflict" gate. Explicitly seek failure modes *before* generation.
- **Key Questions**:
  1. Why would this product fail?
  2. What is the worst-case scenario?
  3. Can we mitigate it now?

### 3.2 Timeboxing / Flow Control

- **Workflow**: `/s` Stage Transitions.
- **Mandate**: Implicit time limits (Total 45m). Each design stage is a time-limited cognitive cycle.
- **Stages**: STAGE 0 (5m) → STAGE 1 (10m) → STAGE 2 (5m) → STAGE 3 (15m) → STAGE 4 (5m) → STAGE 5 (5m).
- **Enforcement**: If limits are exceeded, scope (Khōra) must be reduced.

### 3.3 Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)

- **Workflow**: `/s` STAGE 5 (SE振り返り原則).
- **Mandate**: Every strategic session must conclude with a "Retrospective"—recording **Keep/Problem/Try** and persisting them to Doxa.

### 3.4 Iteration First

- **Workflow**: `/mek` STEP 7 (SE反復原則).
- **Mandate**: All generation results are explicitly labeled as "First Draft". Mandatory prompt for `/dia-` (Quick Review) to encourage the iterative loop.

## 4. Implementation Log: The "Great Rejection" & Internalization (2026-01-30)

During the design phase, a proposal to add `SPRINT:N{}` operators and `agile` modes to `/mek` was rejected.

- **Reason**: Over-engineering. These concepts are already natively representable using existing oscillation (`~`) and loop (`F:xN`) operators.
- **Learning**: True naturalization is the *simplification* of external complexity into the system's core axioms.
- **Result (v6.4/v5.3)**: The philosophy was internalized as processing steps.

## 5. From Philosophy to Structure: The Trust Crisis & Enforcement (2026-01-31)

### 5.1 The Trust Crisis

Implementation v6.4/v5.4 relied on "Self-Checks" (Agent asking itself if it followed principles).

- **Finding**: Self-checks are untrustworthy. They invite confirmation bias and "checked-box" fatigue.
- **Pivot**: Move from *Exhortation* (asking) to *Structural Enforcement* (blocking).

### 5.2 Structural Enforcement (Reliability Levels)

| Level | Method | Reliability |
|:------|:-------|:------------|
| L1 | Self-Check | Low (Deprecated) |
| **L2** | **Structural Enforcement** | Mid (Current Default) |
| **L3** | **Automated Testing** | High (Validator Logic) |

### 5.3 Scale-Based Adaptive Enforcement

Enforcement overhead should be proportional to task scale (**S1 Metron**):

- **Micro**: L2-min (Field presence check only).
- **Meso**: L2-std (Field presence + basic content validation).
- **Macro**: L3 (Strict automated validation).

### 5.4 Final Versions (2026-01-31)

- `/mek` **v6.6**: Mandatory "Fail Scenario" block and "First Draft" marker.
- `/s` **v5.5**: Mandatory 6-STAGE output and KPT retrospective block.
- `workflow_artifact_standard.md`: Updated with the "SE原則 構造的強制" section.
