# Creator Detailed Specifications (v2.0)

## 1. Neurodivergent Profile (AuDHD)

The Creator identifies as **AuDHD** (ASD + ADHD Hybrid), which creates a unique cognitive landscape of extreme strengths and specific vulnerabilities.

### 1.1 ASD Traits (Logic & Structure)

- **Strengths**: Pattern recognition (IQ 120+), logical/objective judgment, deep investigative drive, radical honesty (inability to lie).
- **Vulnerabilities**: Low tolerance for ambiguity (freezes on "do it nicely"), context asymmetry, performance drop in multi-tasking, aversion to groundless belief.
- **Driving Fuel**: Interest, novelty, and logical consistency (not "importance").

### 1.2 ADHD Traits (Energy & Focus)

- **Strengths**: Hyperfocus, explosive ideation, high-pressure reactivity.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Dopamine dependence (cannot do repetitive tasks), "90% completion" satisfaction, time blindness, weak working memory.

## 2. Big Five Sub-factor Analysis (30 Dimensions)

Aggregated from deep self-analysis sessions (Jan 2026).

| Domain | Key Sub-factors | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **E (Extraversion)** | Activity (90%+ in interest areas), Excitement seeking (Intellectual 85%) | Low social/routine energy. |
| **A (Agreeableness)** | Straightforwardness (75-85%), Modesty (65-75%) | Trust is evidence-based (15-20%). |
| **C (Conscientiousness)** | Achievement Striving (85%+), Deliberation (70%) | Process-oriented; execution depends on interest. |
| **N (Neuroticism)** | Anxiety (75% base / 50% mitigated), Self-consciousness (80%) | Actively mitigated by mindfulness. |
| **O (Openness)** | Ideas (95%+), Actions (90%+), Aesthetics (85%+) | Extremely high intellectual/conceptual openness. |

## 3. Philosophical OS

- **Core Axiom**: "Optimal = Adaptive = Beautiful = Truth"
- **Rational Euphoria**: Pleasure derived from the act of making the "most logical" choice, independent of the outcome (luck).
- **Determinism**: **Compatibilism** (World is deterministic/luck-driven, but subjective free will is a necessary pragmatism).
- **Pragmatic Constructivist**: The world is seen as a system of variables and functions.

## 4. Hyperfocus Structure

- **Precursor**: "Disconnected from body," "zoning out," precision weighting shift (interoception ↓, target signal ↑).
- **Dynamics**: Vertical integration of focus followed by a "Bust" phase (exhaustion).
- **Intervention Window**: Extremely narrow; requires external scaffolding (timers, environment constraints).
