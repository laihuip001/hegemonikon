# Axial Philosophy of Hegemonikón (A3 Gnōmē)

## 1. Six Layer Maxims (Hegemonikón 六層格言)

The "Zero-Trust Doctrine" is built on the systematic exclusion of subjective drift across all six layers of cognitive operation.

| Layer | Exclude (Subjective) | Rely On (Objective) | Maxim |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **O (Ousia)** | 妄想 (Delusion) | 観察 (Observation) | Rely on observation, not delusion. |
| **S (Schema)** | 希望 (Hope) | 予測 (Prediction) | Rely on prediction, not hope. |
| **H (Hormē)** | 願望 (Wish) | 法則 (Law) | Rely on law, not wish. |
| **P (Perigraphē)** | 理想 (Ideals) | 現実 (Reality) | Rely on reality, not ideals. |
| **K (Kairos)** | 都合 (Convenience) | 時機 (Timing) | Rely on timing, not convenience. |
| **A (Akribeia)** | 感情 (Emotion) | 論理 (Logic) | Rely on logic, not emotion. |

## 2. Hegemonikón Twin Pillars (Stoa Techné kai Aletheia)

Hegemonikón's operation is balanced between two vertical axioms known as the **Twin Pillars**. 
One governs the creation of the future (Praxis), the other governs the recognition of the present (Noēsis).

| Pillar | Maxim (Japanese) | Maxim (English) | Focus | CCL Mapping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar of Design** (Techné) | 「希望ではなく予測で設計せよ」 | Design by prediction, not by hope. | Future/Mekis | `/pis ▷ /mek` |
| **Pillar of Being** (Aletheia) | 「望むことではなく、在ることに従え」 | Not what you wish, but what is. | Present/Ousia | `/noe ▷ /ore` |

### 2.1 The Zero-Trust Doctrine Refined
**"Eliminate wishful thinking; design realistically and logically based on observed facts."**

Zero-Trust does not mean "total deactivation of agency" but rather **"graduated enforcement based on predictive precision."** We do not "hope" that an LLM will follow a complex instruction; we "predict" its failure points and structure the environment (templates, validators, quizzes) to make failure impossible.

## 2. The Logic of Necessity (Anankē)

**"Don't ask 'how to write', ask 'what is inevitable' (何が必然か)."**

In a system of structural integrity, implementation details are secondary to structural necessity. Writing without first questioning its inevitability leads to bloat and "shameful" (non-logical) artifacts.

### 2.1 Necessity over Elegance

Elegance without necessity is vanity. True elegance is the realization of absolute necessity—where nothing can be removed without the system collapsing.

## 3. High-Integrity Axioms

### 3.1 Refinement vs. Reduction (Catharsis)

- **Reduction** is mere subtraction to simplify.
- **Refinement** is the discovery of the underlying inevitable structure.

### 3.2 Holistic Verification (Quine-Duhem Holism)
>
> **「個々の命題は隔離不可能であり、全体的知識体系の枠組みの中ではじめて検証可能なのである」**

Verification of a single artifact in isolation is incomplete. True validation occurs when the artifact is integrated into the 6-series matrix and survives cross-validation by the total knowledge system.

### 3.3 Documentation as Long-Term Memory

Documented decisions are artifacts of long-term memory. They serve:

- **Self-continuation**: Allowing the AI to reconstruct its reasoning chain.
- **Traceable Proof**: Proving "why" a structure exists to the Architect.

### 3.4 Metaphor vs. Mechanism Distinction

Clearly distinguish between:

- **Metaphorical Scaffolding**: Conceptual aids (e.g., "FEP as homeostasis").
- **Validated Mechanisms**: Technical implementation (e.g., Code, Proof Injectors).

### 3.5 Skeleton / Flesh / Interface (Cognitive Implementation)

The Hegemonikón cognitive engine follows a three-layer realization:

1. **Skeleton (公理/骨格)**: The deductive, symbolic structure defined by CCL axioms. It ensures recoverability and logical necessity.
2. **Flesh (意味/肉付け)**: The semantic content, dialogue history, and nuanced explanations that fill the skeleton.
3. **Interface (界面/演算)**: The active operators (+, -, *, !) and workflows that allow the Architect and Assistant to interact and transform the system.

## 4. Systemic Design Principles (v1.0, 2026-02-01)

Extracted from the comprehensive mining of 536 session insights.

1. **Proof Depth Principle (証明深度原則)**:
   - **Proof Depth ∝ Responsibility of Existence**.
   - Logic: The more critical a file's role (e.g., `fep_agent.py`), the deeper the proof required (deduced directly from axioms). Scripts or ephemeral files require less granular proof.
2. **Function Activability (機能発動可能性)**:
   - "A feature must be invokable."
   - Design Balance: **60% Classical Philosophy : 40% Modern Cognitive Science**. Naming must be consistent (Greek) but functional design must reflect modern cognitive capabilities.
3. **Orthogonal Design (直交設計)**:
   - Theorems must be designed to be orthogonal. The O, S, H, P, K, A series represent non-overlapping axes of cognitive operation.
4. **Structural Embedding (構造への埋め込み)**:
   - "Do not just 'write' philosophy; embed it into the structure." (構造に組み込むべき).
   - Logic: Principles (like Anti-Skip) are more effective when enforced by the system (templates/validators) rather than just described in a prompt.
5. **Quality vs. Quantity (The 1,000 > 2,000 Law)**:
   - A 1,000-token highly structured prompt is superior to a 2,000-token verbose/redundant prompt. Conciseness is a marker of high structural integrity.

## 5. Operational Gnomai (v2.5)

- **Necessity-First Principle**: Do not generate files or code unless their existence is proven necessary by a theorem.
- **No-Debt Principle**:
  1. AI as Closer: Every session must target a "closed" state.
  2. Immediate Naturalization: External knowledge must be digested into native theorems immediately.
  3. Closure over Expansion: Prioritize fixing/hardening current structures over adding new ones.
- **Idea Reuse / Recasting Principle**: Ideas must never be trapped in a single context. Recast external insights and successful patterns across all 6 series (O, S, H, P, K, A) to maximize intellectual leverage.
- **Counter-Entropy (Hollow Form Risk)**: Structural enforcement must not become "hollow." A protocol (like Anti-Skip) is hollow if it fulfills terminal requirements without semantic depth. Prevent this via adversarial questioning and tiered scrutiny.
