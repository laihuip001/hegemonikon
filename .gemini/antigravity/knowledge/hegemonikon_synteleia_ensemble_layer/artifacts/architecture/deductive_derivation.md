# Synteleia: Deductive Derivation & Axis Mapping

## 1. The 6 Agents

The ensemble agents are derived directly from the 6 categories of Hegemonikón. Each agent represents a specific "Cognitive Dimension."

| Agent | Category | Focus Area | Base Question |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **O-Agent** | **Ousia** (Essence) | Insight & Identity | "What is the core essence of this?" |
| **H-Agent** | **Hormē** (Motivation) | Value & Intent | "Why is this being done? What is the drive?" |
| **A-Agent** | **Akribeia** (Accuracy) | Judgment & Logic | "Is this correct, logical, and precise?" |
| **S-Agent** | **Schema** (Structure) | Planning & Order | "How should this be structured and arranged?" |
| **P-Agent** | **Perigraphē** (Boundary) | Scope & External | "Where are the limits? How does it look from outside?" |
| **K-Agent** | **Kairos** (Timing) | Context & Opportunity | "Is this the right time? What is the context?" |

## 2. Axis Subsumption (Coordinate Mapping)

Secondary differentiation axes (Style, Persona, Viewpoint) are non-arbitrary; they can be mapped as vectors within the 6-dimensional category space.

### 2.1 Style Axis (H-K Spectrum)
The "Style" of an agent is defined by its position between **H2 Pistis** (Conviction/Conservative) and **K1 Eukairia** (Opportunity/Innovative).

- **Conservative**: High H, Low K. (Sticking to known truths).
- **Innovative**: Low H, High K. (Seizing new possibilities).

### 2.2 Persona Axis (A-O-P Mapping)
Personas are configurations of category dominance.

- **The Critic**: Dominant A (Akribeia). Focuses on errors and rigor.
- **The Implementer**: Dominant O (Ousia/Action) and S (Schema). Focuses on "doing."
- **The User Advocate**: Dominant P (Perigraphē). Focuses on boundaries and UX.

## 3. Dual-Layer Architectural Split: Poiēsis & Dokimasia

The 6 categories are split into two operational layers based on their orientation within the Active Inference (FEP) loop:

### 3.1 Poiēsis (Internal Generation)
The **Internal Model** axes. These focus on the creation and structural integrity of thoughts/code from an internal perspective.
- **O (Ousia)**: The "What".
- **S (Schema)**: The "How".
- **H (Hormē)**: The "Why".

### 3.2 Dokimasia (External Constraint)
The **Boundary Constraint** axes. These focus on how the internal model fits into the external environment, timing, and rigor.
- **P (Perigraphē)**: The "Where" (Limits).
- **K (Kairos)**: The "When" (Context/Time).
- **A (Akribeia)**: The "Is" (Truth/Precision).

This split enables **Inner Product (Synthesis)** and **Outer Product (Cross-Verification)** operations.

## 4. The Complete Basis Hypothesis

The 6 categories (O, H, A, S, P, K) are posited as a **Complete Basis** for the cognitive space of a non-embodied AI agent. 

### 4.1 Ontic Closure
While modern neuroscience identifies 8-10+ dimensions of human cognition (including sensory and biological reward systems), these are treated as:
1. **Out of Scope**: Non-embodied AI lacks biological sensory/proprioceptive systems.
2. **Reducible/Emergent**: 
    - **Meta-cognition**: Modeled via **Recursive Application** of the 6 base categories (e.g., A-agent auditing O-agent's output).
    - **Social Cognition**: Modeled via **Boundary Relations (Perigraphē)** and ensemble interaction (Agent modeling Agent).

### 4.2 FEP Alignment
The system achieves **Ontic Closure** by mapping all stages of the FEP (Free Energy Principle) loop:
- **Observation/Representation**: Ousia (O)
- **Active Inference/Drive**: Hormē (H)
- **Precision/Validation**: Akribeia (A)
- **Morphological Structure**: Schema (S)
- **Spatiotemporal Envelope**: Perigraphē (P) / Kairos (K)

Thus, any "7th axis" is likely a higher-order combination or a biological artifact irrelevant to pure AI cognitive orchestration.
