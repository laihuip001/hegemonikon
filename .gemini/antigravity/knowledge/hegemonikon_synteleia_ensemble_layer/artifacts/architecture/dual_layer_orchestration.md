# Dual-Layer Orchestration: Poiēsis and Dokimasia

Synteleia organizes the 6 core categories of Hegemonikón into two distinct functional layers to manage cognitive load and streamline the orchestration of specialist agents.

## 1. The Architectural Split

The split is based on the agent's orientation within the **Active Inference (FEP)** cycle and whether their primary role is internal construction or external constraint.

### Layer 1: Poiēsis (ποίηση — "Production/Genesis")
Focuses on the **Generative** internal development of the world model. These agents answer the "What, How, and Why" of a cognitive action.
- **Ousia (O)**: **Essence Recognition**. Answers "What it is".
- **Schema (S)**: **Structural Design**. Answers "How it is built".
- **Hormē (H)**: **Motivation Evaluation**. Answers "Why it is built".

### Layer 2: Dokimasia (δοκιμασία — "Scrutiny/Examination")
Focuses on the **Evaluatative** external constraints and rigor. These agents answer the "Where, When, and Is" of a cognitive action.
- **Perigraphē (P)**: **Boundary Mapping**. Answers "Where it ends" (Scope).
- **Kairos (K)**: **Timing/Context Judgment**. Answers "When it occurs".
- **Akribeia (A)**: **Precision/Rigor**. Answers "Is it correct" (Accuracy/Logic).

## 2. Theoretical Justification

- **Poiēsis** represents the *Internal Prediction* within the FEP loop—the creative impulse constrained by internal coherence.
- **Dokimasia** represents the *Boundary Scrutiny* and *Precision Weighting*—the critical audit against environmental constraints and logical rules.

This hierarchy allows Synteleia to first "create" (Poiēsis) and then "verify" (Dokimasia), or to run them in parallel for real-time cognitive balance.
