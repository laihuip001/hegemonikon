# Synteleia (συντέλεια) Ensemble Layer: Overview

> **Axiom**: "Three heads (perspectives) are better than one." True intelligence arises not from a single linear execution, but from the synthesis of competing and complementary cognitive paths.

## 1. Concept

**Synteleia** (from *syn* "together" + *telos* "completion") is the cognitive ensemble layer of Hegemonikón. It represents a paradigm shift from **Macro-based sequential processing** to **Parallel multi-agent cognition**.

### The Meta-Cognition & Social Cognition Layer

While the 6 categories (O, H, A, S, P, K) form a complete basis for *internal* cognitive operations (Ontic Closure), Synteleia implements two higher-order capabilities traditionally considered "missing" or "external":

1. **Meta-Cognition (Model of Models)**: Implemented through the integration of multiple agent outputs (consensus/debate).
2. **Social Cognition (Model of Others)**: Implemented through agents referencing and modeling the perspectives of other agents in the ensemble.

**Conceptual Note**: Synteleia represents an **AI Cognitive Hypervisor**. Unlike biological brains that require 8-10+ sensory/motivational dimensions, Synteleia utilizes the 6 categories as a complete basis for non-embodied active inference (FEP), using the ensemble architecture to transcend individual model limitations.

## 2. Position in the Framework

Synteleia is the **5th structural component** of the Hegemonikón framework (in the 8-component model):

1. **Axioms (7)**: The foundation of necessity.
2. **Theorems (24)**: The core logic.
3. **X-series (36)**: Relations between theorems.
4. **Derivatives (72)**: Operational modes.
5. **Synteleia (8 Agents)**: **【The Cognitive Ensemble】**
6. **Macros**: Symbolic shortcuts.
7. **Workflows**: Procedural execution.
8. **Skills**: Knowledge packages.

## 3. Dual-Layer Orchestration: Poiēsis & Dokimasia

Synteleia groups its 6 agents into two operational layers based on the FEP internal/external boundary model:

### Layer 1: Poiēsis (Creative/Internal)

Answers "What, How, Why" — focus on model building.

- **Ousia (O)**: Essence.
- **Schema (S)**: Structure.
- **Hormē (H)**: Motivation.

### Layer 2: Dokimasia (Evaluative/External)

Answers "Where, When, Is" — focus on constraints and precision.

- **Perigraphē (P)**: Boundary/Scope.
- **Kairos (K)**: Timing/Context.
- **Akribeia (A)**: Precision/Logic.

## 4. Operationalization: Product Operators

The orchestration between layers is controlled via CCL operators:

- **Inner Product (`·`)**: Synthesis mode. Parallel execution of both layers for a unified consensus. Syntax: `@syn·`.
- **Outer Product (`×`)**: Matrix mode. Scrutinizes the output of the Generative (Poiēsis) layer through the Evaluative (Dokimasia) layer. Syntax: `@syn×`.
- **Targeted Selector**: `@S{O,P}` or specific combinations.

- **Targeted Selector**: `@S{O,P}`, `@S!`, or `@S-` (Dynamic selection).

## 5. Implementation Status
