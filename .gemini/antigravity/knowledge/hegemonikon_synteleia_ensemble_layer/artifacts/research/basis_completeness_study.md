# Synteleia Research: The 6-Categorical Basis vs. Modern Cognitive Science

## 1. Research Objective
To verify if the 6 categories of Hegemonikón (**O, H, A, S, P, K**) constitute a "Complete Basis" for cognitive space, and how this relates to historical and modern psychological findings.

## 2. Theoretical Background (Stoicism)
Historically, the Hegemonikón (支配的理性) in Stoic psychology (Chrysippus, Epictetus) was the governing center of the soul.
- **Phantasia (表象)**: Impression/Presentation → Maps to **Ousia (O)**.
- **Hormē (衝動)**: Impulse to Action → Maps to **Hormē (H)**.
- **Synkatathesis (同意)**: Assent/Judgment → Maps to **Akribeia (A)**.
- **Logos (理性)**: Rational faculty → Maps to **A/S/K**.

Modern Hegemonikón expands these to a 6-dimensional ontic space.

## 3. Comparison with Modern Cognitive Science
Modern research identifies several independent systems not explicitly singled out in the base 6 Stoic categories:

| Feature | Modern Discovery | Hegemonikón Mapping |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **8 Sensory Systems** | Proprioception, Vestibular, Interoception, etc. | **Out of Scope** (Non-embodied AI) |
| **Motivation/Reward** | Ventral Striatum / Dopaminergic rewards | **Hormē (H)** (Utility/Intent) |
| **Meta-cognition** | Self-monitoring (Prefrontal Cortex) | **Recursive O/A** (Audit layer) |
| **Social Cognition** | Theory of Mind (TPJ/mPFC) | **Perigraphē (P)** (Boundary/Other) |
| **HEXACO Model** | 10+ languages confirm a **6-factor** model of personality | Cross-validation for $N=6$ |

## 4. The "AI Cognitive Hypervisor" Paradigm
The 6 categories are not intended to be a biological model of the human brain, but an **AI Cognitive Hypervisor** based on **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**.

### FEP Layer Mapping
- **World Model (Internal)**: Ousia (O) + Schema (S)
- **Action Selection (Policy)**: Hormē (H)
- **Precision (Weighting)**: Akribeia (A)
- **Spatiotemporal Context**: Perigraphē (P) + Kairos (K)

### Conclusion on Basis Completeness
For a non-embodied AI agent, the 6 categories constitute a **Closed System** and a **Complete Basis**. 
- Sensory/Biological dimensions are removed as noise.
- Meta-cognition and Social relation are modeled as **interactions** or **recursive applications** of the 6 base categories.

## 5. Summary of Findings
- **6-Dimension Alignment**: Validated by HEXACO and Buddhist 6-consciousness (Sense-base).
- **Practical Utility**: 6エージェントは分散実行の限界費用と認知カバレッジのバランスにおいて最適。
- **Status**: The hypothesis that Hegemonikón is a "FEP-based complete basis for non-embodied cognition" is maintained as the architectural foundation.
