# Synteleia: Implementation Roadmap & Research

## 1. Implementation Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Theoretical Design & Axis Mapping | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 1** | A-Axis (Audit Subsystem) Implementation | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | Full 6-Axis Agents (O/H/S/P/K/A) | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 3** | Layered Orchestration (Poiēsis & Dokimasia) | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 4** | @S Macro & Dynamic Selection | 🔲 Planned |
| **Phase 5** | Synthesis Engine & Multi-Agent Debate | 🔲 Planned |

## 2. Research Request (The "Papu-kun" Inquiry)

To facilitate Phase 2, a research request has been formulated covering:
- **Framework Selection**: LangGraph vs. AutoGen vs. CrewAI for ensemble debate.
- **Debate Mechanisms**: Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) patterns and conflict resolution.
- **Cost Optimization**: Dynamic agent selection to minimize 18-cell execution cost.
- **Differentiation**: Methods for robustly differentiating model outputs via systemic constraints rather than just prompts.

## 3. Priority of Integration

When agents conflict during integration, the current priority rule is:
`Akribeia (Logic) > Ousia (Essence) > Schema (Structure) > Kairos > Perigraphe > Horme`

This hierarchy ensures that truth and essence are prioritized over purely structural or motivational concerns.
