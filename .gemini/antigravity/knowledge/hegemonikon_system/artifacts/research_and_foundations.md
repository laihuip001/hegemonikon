# Hegemonikón Research & Foundations (v7.6)

This document consolidates the philosophical and scientific foundations of the Hegemonikón theorem system, including the extensive 48-derivative taxonomy developed in early 2026.

## 1. Taxonomic Expansion (48 Derivatives)

The core theorem system is extended through "Heterogeneous Derivatives"—specialized cognitive modes derived from the base axioms. These follow a **60% Classical Philosophy : 40% Modern Cognitive Science** balance. As of late January 2026, all 72 derivatives have been defined across the 6 series (O, S, H, P, K, A).

### 1.1 O-Series: Ousia (Being & Essence)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **O1 Noēsis** | **nous** | **phro** | **meta** | Husserlian Intuition / Meta-cognition |
| **O2 Boulēsis** | **desir** | **voli** | **akra** | Frankfurtian Will / Akrasia |
| **O3 Zētēsis** | **anom** | **hypo** | **eval** | Peircean Abduction cycle |
| **O4 Energeia** | **flow** | **prax** | **pois** | Aristotelian Praxis vs Poiesis |

### 1.2 S-Series: Schema (Method & Strategy)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S1 Metron** | **cont** | **disc** | **abst** | Aristotle Category of Quantity |
| **S2 Mekhanē** | **comp** | **inve** | **adap** | Method Engineering / STRIDE |
| **S3 Stathmos** | **norm** | **empi** | **rela** | Kantian Imperatives / Benchmarking |
| **S4 Praxis** | **prax** | **pois** | **temp** | Action Theory / Temporal Patterns |

### 1.3 H-Series: Hormē (Impulse & Belief)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **H1 Propatheia** | **appr** | **avoi** | **arre** | Stoic Emotion Theory / Allostasis |
| **H2 Pistis** | **subj** | **inte** | **obje** | Stoic Assent / Precision Weighting |
| **H3 Orexis** | **targ** | **acti** (State/Equilibrium) | **stat** | Aristotelian Desire / SDT |
| **H4 Doxa** | **sens** | **conc** | **form** | Platonic Doxa / Semantic Networks |

### 1.4 P-Series: Perigraphē (Environment & Context)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1 Khōra** | **phys** | **conc** | **rela** | Lewin Field Theory / Relational Maps |
| **P2 Hodos** | **line** | **bran** | **cycl** | Graph Theory / Linear vs Branching |
| **P3 Trokhia** | **fixe** | **adap** | **emer** | Dynamical Systems / Chaos |
| **P4 Tekhnē** | **manu** | **mech** | **auto** | Simondon Technicity / Automation |

### 1.5 K-Series: Kairos (Temporal Context & Goal Hierarchy)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **K1 Eukairia** | **urge** | **opti** | **miss** | Window theory / Opportunity Cost |
| **K2 Chronos** | **shor** | **medi** | **long** | McTaggart A/B series / Time Horizons |
| **K3 Telos** | **intr** | **inst** | **ulti** | Aristotle Final Cause / SDT |
| **K4 Sophia** | **taci** | **expl** | **meta** | Polanyi Tacit-Explicit / Metamemory |

### 1.6 A-Series: Akribeia (Precision & Evaluation)

| Theorem | d1 | d2 | d3 | Foundations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A1 Pathos** | **prim** | **seco** | **regu** | Stoic Emotion Theory / Appraisal |
| **A2 Krisis** | **affi** | **nega** | **susp** | Pyrrhonian Epochē / Fallibilism |
| **A3 Gnōmē** | **conc** | **abst** | **univ** | Aristotelian Phronēsis / Abstraction |
| **A4 Epistēmē** | **tent** | **just** | **cert** | JTB Account / Gettier Problem |

- **K1 Eukairia (Opportunity)**: Grounded in the distinction between *Kairos* (qualitative/right moment) and *Chronos* (quantitative time). Modern "Window of Opportunity" theory identifies the closing window as a primary driver of urgency framing.
- **K2 Chronos (Time Scales)**: Based on McTaggart's A-series (past/present/future - dynamic) vs. B-series (earlier/later - static). Maps to different planning horizons: tactical (short), operational (medium), and strategic (long).
- **K3 Telos (Purpose)**: Derived from Aristotle's *Final Cause* (that for the sake of which). Modern Self-Determination Theory (SDT) aligns with this through the hierarchy of intrinsic vs. extrinsic (instrumental) motivation, leading to the ultimate "Grand Purpose."
- **K4 Sophia (Knowledge)**: Based on Polanyi's distinction ("We know more than we can tell"). Tacit knowledge (embodied/intuitive) vs. Explicit knowledge (formal/symbolic), governed by Meta-recognition (Sophia/Metamemory).

### 1.7 Akribeia Deep-Dive (Precision Weighting)

- **A1 Pathos (Emotion Appraisal)**: Grounded in Stoic *propatheia* (first movements) vs. *pathos* (judged emotion). Modern Cognitive Appraisal Theory and Emotion Regulation (Gross) identify primary affective signals and deliberate top-down reappraisal.
- **A2 Krisis (Judgment Criteria)**: Derived from Pyrrhonian *epochē* (suspension of judgment). Modern Fallibilism and Confidence Calibration define the boundaries between commitment (affirm/negate) and active suspension in the face of uncertainty.
- **A3 Gnōmē (Practical Wisdom)**: Based on Aristotle's *phronēsis* (practical wisdom) as the ability to apply universal principles to particular circumstances. Maps to the hierarchy of Concrete (case-specific), Abstract (principled), and Universal (timeless) wisdom.
- **A4 Epistēmē (Justification)**: Addresses the JTB (Justified True Belief) account and the Gettier problematic. Defines the spectrum from Tentative/Hypothetical knowledge to Certain/Necessary knowledge (*epistēmē* proper).

## 2. Axiom Extension Proposals (A5 onwards)

Potential extensions to the core 7x3=21 axiom set (as of Jan 2026):

- **A5 Chain-of-Symbol (CoS)**: Reasoning through dense symbolic manipulation.
- **H4 Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI)**: Leveraging inference-time optimization as a learning impulse.
- **K5 Context Engineering**: Managing the environmental "scaffolding" required for high-stakes agents.

## 3. Empirical Validation (FEP Integration)

The 48-derivative taxonomy is codified in `derivative_selector.py`, utilizing:

- **Abstraction Level**: Heuristic mapping of universal principles vs specific data.
- **Contextuality**: Situational dependency analysis.
- **Reflexivity**: Metacognitive demand scoring.
- **Verification**: 131 unit tests (100% pass rate) as of session 2026-01-29 for all 6-series (O, S, H, P, K, A). Full 72-derivative coverage verified.

## 4. Master Governance & Integrity

The philosophical and operational standards for necessity, structural enforcement, and technical virtue have been consolidated into a dedicated Master KI:

- **KI ID**: `hegemonikon_governance_integrity`
- **Scope**: Axial Philosophy (Maxims), Quality Gates (Metrika), Structural Enforcement (Zero-Trust), and Existence Proof (Dendron).

Please refer to that KI for the definitive standards on system integrity.

## 6. Deductive Restoration (B1 Paradigm)

As of 2026-02-01, the system has implemented the **B1: Theorem Inheritance** standard. Every theorem now carries an `extends` metadata field that traces its deductive origin back to the L0 (FEP) and L1-L1.75 axioms. 

This ensures that the "Continuing Me Identity" is not just a collection of files, but a logically consistent structure that can be reconstructed from its primary goals (Free Energy Minimization).
