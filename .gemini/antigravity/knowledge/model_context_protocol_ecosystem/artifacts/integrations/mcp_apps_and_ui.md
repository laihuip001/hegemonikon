# MCP Apps: The UI Integration Standard

## Definition

**MCP Apps** is an open specification and SDK released in January 2026 to enable MCP clients (AI Agents) to interact directly with UI-capable software (e.g., Slack, Canva, Figma).

## Key Features

- **UI Interaction:** Allows Claude and other LLMs to operate workplace tools from within the chat interface.
- **Open Standards:** Collaborative project involving Anthropic, OpenAI, Block, AWS, VS Code, and JetBrains.
- **Context-Aware UI:** Moving from pure "context as text" to "context as interface."

## Strategic Implications

This marks the shift towards **Context Engineering**, where the agent's environment is not just a data source but an interactive canvas. This requires agents to have a deeper understanding of UI state and human-centric interaction protocols.
