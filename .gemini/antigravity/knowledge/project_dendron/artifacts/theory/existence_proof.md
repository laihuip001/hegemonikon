# Project Dendron: Existence Proof System

> **δένδρον (dendron)** = Tree. Structural necessity visualized as a recursive tree.

## Philosophy: Existence Error Minimization

Dendron translates the Free Energy Principle (FEP) — specifically Predictive Error Minimization — into the dimension of code existence. In Hegemonikón, every symbol, file, and directory must justify its presence.

- **Objective**: Zero Arbitrariness.
- **Metric**: Existence Error (Predicted necessity vs. Observed utility).
- **Core Doctrine**: "Proof before Presence."

## The 2nd-Dimension Proof Hierarchy

Hegemonikón achieves "Zero Arbitrariness" through two orthogonal axes of verification.

### 1.1 Meta Layers (The "What" and "Why")

| Layer | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Surface** | Content of the PROOF itself. | Active |
| **Structural** | Dependency mappings (imports). | In Progress |
| **Functional** | Identification of redundant functions. | In Progress |
| **Proof (Empirical)** | "Does it break if deleted?" experiments. | Future |

### 1.2 The 4x4 Verification Matrix

Dendron expands into a complete 16-cell matrix (4 Granularity Layers × 4 Meta Layers).

| Axis | Levels / Layers |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | L0 (Dir), L1 (File), L2 (Block), L3 (Token) |
| **Meta Depth** | Surface, Structural, Functional, Empirical |

Detailed cell definitions and implementation status can be found in [Matrix 4x4 Specification](./matrix_4x4_specification.md).

### 1.3 The "Git of Existence" Analogy

As defined in the 2026-02-01 session, Dendron is the **"Git of Meaning"**:

| Tool | Focus | Institutionalization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Git** | History (When/Who) | Tracking changes to code state. |
| **Dendron** | Justification (Why) | Tracking existence reasons. |

Just as Git tracks "how it changed," Dendron tracks "why it exists." It provides the semantic infrastructure necessary for AI-driven development. In this paradigm, AI generates the *implementation* (Hormē), but the human/governor dictates the **Reason for Being** (Ousia).

## 2. Milestone: 100.0% Coverage

On 2026-02-01, Project Hermēneus (the CCL compiler) achieved the first **100.0% PROOF Coverage** across its entire codebase (240+ files). This demonstrated that:

1. Massive code generation by AI can be held to 100% justification standards.
2. The `dendron check` tool can serve as a non-negotiable CI gate.
3. Existence Proof is not just documentation; it's a verifiable system.

## Paradigmatic Value

In the age of AI-accelerated "Vibe Coding," Dendron shifts the burden of proof from the human reviewer to the code itself.

- **Traditional Review**: "What does this do?"
- **Dendron Review**: "Is this proof of necessity valid?"
