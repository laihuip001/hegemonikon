    "title": "Project Hermeneus: CCL Execution Guarantee Compiler",
    "summary": "Hermēneus (Ἑρμηνεύς) is a high-performance compiler designed to translate Cognitive Control Language (CCL/CPL) into executable LMQL and LangGraph programs. As of 2026-02-01, v0.8.0 introduces a DSPy-based Optimizer and Grounded Cognitive Loops. Integration with Synteleia enables high-fidelity code-base audits, identifying the translation layer as the primary stability bottleneck and establishing the 'Anti-Airp' protocol for grounded analysis.",
