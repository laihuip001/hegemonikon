# Creativity & Reasoning: Case Studies & Engines

This document consolidates case studies in architectural reasoning and the mechanisms for creative divergence and logic mitigation.

## 1. Architectural Reasoning Compendium

The `/noe` workflow is used to resolve structural ambiguities based on first principles.

### 1.1 Case Studies
- **Mnēmē Synthesis (2026-01-28)**: Successfully integrated `mneme_cli.py` as a thin wrapper in the recollection layer, ingestng 84 documents.
- **Anti-Skip Protocol**: Identified as "Thought Trace Visualization". Recommendations include Hollow Detection and Tiered Verification.
- **Digestion Scale Analyzer**: Standalone module rejected; integrated as "Stage 0 Gate" in `/plan v3.0`.
- **Skill-WF Severance Hardening**: Initiated **Project Mekhanē** to solve bidirectional linking and sync verification between 209 modes and SKILL.md theorem definitions.

## 2. Epochē: Judgment Suspension Strategy

**Objective**: Minimize calibration error and pre-empt hallucinated certainty.

### 2.1 Trigger Conditions
- Confidence $\le 0.6$.
- Missing data/competence boundary detection.
- Contradiction detected during reasoning.

### 2.2 Execution Sequence
1. **L1: Preamble**: Declare `[Epochē: Suspension of Judgment Activated]`.
2. **L2: Verification**: Apply Chain of Verification (CoVe).
3. **L3: Markers**: State confidence and cause of uncertainty.
4. **L4: Route**: Path A (Full Suspension) or Path B (Tentative Estimate).

## 3. Creativity Engines: A-2 [Prism] & A-8 [Kaleidoscope]

Lateral Shift and Combinatorial Innovation modules.

### 3.1 Module A-2 [Prism]: Lateral Shift
- **De Bono [PO] (Provocation)**: Using absurd premises as bridges to new insights.
- **TRIZ Contradiction Solver**: Resolving technical/physical contradictions.
- **Oblique Strategies**: Abstract poetic prompts to force perspective shifts.

### 3.2 Module A-8 [Kaleidoscope]: Morphological Matrix
- **Morphological Analysis**: Combine 4+ parameters (Axes) with 5 values each.
- **Forced Collision**: Forced rationalization of random combinations to find the "innovation kernel."

## 4. Tekhne-Maker vs. Workbenches

Tekhne-Maker prioritizes **Structural Enforcement** (Prompt-Lang) and **Metacognitive Gates** (Internal Council) over the free-form GUI experimentation typical of external workbenches.
