    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study developed a Python-based framework to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations on cohesionless soil, employing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 116 footing experiments, Eleven ML models (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) etc.) and five DL models (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), etc.) trained and compared against traditional methods. Input parameters included foundation dimensions and soil properties. Results demonstrated that ML and DL models significantly outperformed traditional equations, achieving higher accuracy. Ensemble methods like GPR, XGBoost, GBM, RF, and CatBoost exhibited superior performance, with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) values above 0.988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 5.07%. Conversely, traditional methods showed lower accuracy, with R2 values ranging from 0.684 to 0.82 and MAPE exceeding 19.63%. Taylor diagram analysis confirmed the improved performance of ML and DL. Additionally, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted foundation depth and soil friction angle as the most influential parameters, consistent with geotechnical principles.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose GAIA, a generative AI architecture based on category theory. GAIA is based on a hierarchical model where modules are organized as a simplicial complex. Each simplicial complex updates its internal parameters biased on information it receives from its superior simplices and in turn relays updates to its subordinate sub-simplices. Parameter updates are formulated in terms of lifting diagrams over simplicial sets, where inner and outer horn extensions correspond to different types of learning problems. Backpropagation is modeled as an endofunctor over the category of parameters, leading to a coalgebraic formulation of deep learning.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The integration of knowledge extracted from diverse models, whether described by domain experts or generated by machine learning algorithms, has historically been challenged by the absence of a suitable framework for specifying and integrating structures, learning processes, data transformations, and data models or rules. In this work, we extend algebraic specification methods to address these challenges within such a framework. In our work, we tackle the challenging task of developing a comprehensive framework for defining and analyzing deep learning architectures. We believe that previous efforts have fallen short by failing to establish a clear connection between the constraints a model must adhere to and its actual implementation. Our methodology employs graphical structures that resemble Ehresmann's sketches, interpreted within a universe of fuzzy sets. This approach offers a unified theory that elegantly encompasses both deterministic and non-deterministic neural network designs. Furthermore, we highlight how this theory naturally incorporates fundamental concepts from computer science and automata theory. Our extended algebraic specification framework, grounded in graphical structures akin to Ehresmann's sketches, offers a promising solution for integrating knowledge across disparate models and domains. By bridging the gap between domain-specific expertise and machine-generated insights, we pave the way for more comprehensive, collaborative, and effective approaches to knowledge integration and modeling.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "We provide a construction for categorical representation learning and introduce the foundations of ‘categorifier’. The central theme in representation learning is the idea of everything to vector. Every object in a dataset S can be represented as a vector in Rn by an encoding map E:Obj(S)→Rn . More importantly, every morphism can be represented as a matrix E:Hom(S)→Rnn . The encoding map E is generally modeled by a deep neural network. The goal of representation learning is to design appropriate tasks on the dataset to train the encoding map (assuming that an encoding is optimal if it universally optimizes the performance on various tasks). However, the latter is still a set-theoretic approach. The goal of the current article is to promote the representation learning to a new level via a category-theoretic approach. As a proof of concept, we provide an example of a text translator equipped with our technology, showing that our categorical learning model outperforms the current deep learning models by 17 times.

    "title": "A Machine Learning Model for Pile Settlement Prediction Using Majority Voting-Based Feature Selection",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Pile foundations are deep foundations commonly employed in bridge construction, high-rise buildings, trains, and situations requiring high bearing capacity and minimal settlement. Accurate prediction of pile settlement is essential for ensuring the safety and stability of deep foundations, yet traditional methods like in-situ load tests are often costly and impractical. The cone penetration test (CPT) is one of the most frequent in-situ tests for pile analysis because, like a model pile, the measured cone resistance and sleeve fiction can be used to estimate pile unit toe and shaft resistances, respectively. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework for pile settlement prediction with a genetic algorithm (GA) majority voting (MV) feature selection (FS) strategy to enhance model performance is presented. Three tree-based algorithms, each with a unique approach for tree development and feature handling—categorical boosting (CB), light gradient boosting (LGB), and random forest (RF) are selected for this purpose. The dataset was compiled from fifty-six pile case histories in different countries have been compiled including static loading tests which include maintained load tests and constant rate of penetration tests, shaft, and toe resistances which comprise CPT and CPTu (undrained CPT) sounding, the pile geometric and mechanical properties, the loads applied from the load tests as the model inputs, and recorded settlement values for the piles from the tests as the model output to be predicted. The CB model, coupled with the GA-MV approach, achieved the best predictive accuracy, yielding an <I>R²</I> of 0.926 and RMSE of 5.92 mm upon testing, while feature importance analysis identifies applied load (P) and pile length (L) as key predictors of settlement. Also, an overall decrease of the RMSE by 11.19% was observed between the CB-GAMV model (5.92 mm) and the CB-All features model (6.68 mm), and 9.41% between the CB-GAMV model and the CB-GA model (6.54 mm) on the validation set.\n",

    "abstract": "Discussed are problems of modern mathematical education: the development of the conceptual apparatus of mathematics, as well as the development of thinking in modal categories when proving mathematical propositions and solving probabilistic problems. The work is based on the results of the explication of the ontological foundations of mathematics obtained earlier. It is shown that the basis of a holistic, deep perception of the mathematical laws of being is categorical intuition with subsequent rationalization of mathematical objects. It is emphasized that such objects are not always possible to describe by means of extensional logic: an important place in the categorical structuring of mathematical knowledge is occupied by ontic modalities of the necessary and possible. The author expresses concern about the tendency of algorithmization of mathematical thinking in the learning process as opposed to historically established methods of creative search for proofs, alternatives, and opportunities. Special attention is paid to the topic of the teacher’s implementation of the ideological and educational function of mathematical science. Taking into account the enormous development of computing and information technologies, it is necessary to remember about the anthropological and humanitarian components of modern science and education. In substantiation of the relevance and discussion of the raised issues, the points of view of specialists from various fields are given: mathematicians, historians, teachers. This article is addressed to a wide range of readers: scientists, teachers, graduate students, freelance researchers.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Research into machine learning and deep learning methods for image categorization has been sparked by the explosion of visual content available on digital platforms, with particular interest in domains such as food image recognition. With so many food-related images available on the internet and social media platforms, automated food image categorization is a major difficulty. Deep Convolutional Neural Network architectures offer a promising approach by leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning to extract meaningful image representations. EfficientNetB0 is an example of a pre-trained deep learning architecture that has demonstrated impressive ability in extracting high-level features from images. This study explores the effectiveness of using deep features extracted from the average pooling layer of a fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model for the classification of complex food images using the Food-101 dataset. Subsequently, the features extracted are passed as input to a Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) classifier. To assess performance, we compare the classification accuracies of CatBoost, Support Vector Machines with various kernels, and a Random Forest classifier, all utilizing the same set of extracted features, against the accuracy of the end-to-end fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model. Our experiments reveal that the proposed EfficientNetB0-CatBoost framework achieves the highest classification accuracy for classifying complex food images, highlighting the potential of CatBoost for efficient classification of deep features.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) - a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data, relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables(ii) the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges including large scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models that can transform the processing of relational data.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.",

Unlike prior surveys that focus primarily on either architecture design or learning strategies, we adopt a holistic perspective that emphasizes the universality and robustness of representation learning methods across diverse downstream tasks. We examine recent advances in data augmentation and generation, specialized neural network architectures tailored to tabular data, and innovative learning objectives that enhance representation quality. Additionally, we highlight the growing influence of self-supervised learning and the adaptation of transformer-based foundation models for tabular data. Our review is based on a systematic literature search using rigorous inclusion criteria, encompassing 127 papers published since 2020 in top-tier conferences and journals. Through detailed analysis and comparison, we identify emerging trends, critical gaps, and promising directions for future research, aiming to guide the development of more generalizable and effective tabular data representation methods.",

Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory -- precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps -- as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.",

At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible. This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems. In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Large-scale mapping of soil resources can be crucial and indispensable for several of the managerial applications and policy implications. With machine learning models being the most utilized modeling technique for digital soil mapping (DSM), the implementation of model-based deep learning methods for spatial soil predictions is still under scrutiny. In this study, soil continuous (pH and OC) and categorical variables (order and suborder) were predicted using deep learning–multi layer perceptron (DL-MLP) and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) for the entire state of Tamil Nadu, India. For training the deep learning models, 27,098 profile observations (0–30 cm) were extracted from the generated soil database, considering soil series as the distinctive stratum. A total of 43 SCORPAN-based environmental covariates were considered, of which 37 covariates were retained after the recursive feature elimination (RFE) process. The validation and test results obtained for each of the soil attributes for both the algorithms were most comparable with the DL-MLP algorithm depicting the attributes’ most intricate spatial organization details, compared to the 1D-CNN model. Irrespective of the algorithms and datasets, the R2 and RMSE values of the pH attribute ranged from 0.15 to 0.30 and 0.97 to 1.15, respectively. Similarly, the R2 and RMSE of the OC attribute ranged from 0.20 to 0.39 and 0.38 to 0.42, respectively. Further, the overall accuracy (OA) of the order and suborder classification ranged from 39% to 67% and 35% to 64%, respectively. The explicit quantification of the covariate importance derived from the permutation feature importance implied that both the models tried to incorporate the covariate importance with respect to the genesis of the soil attribute under study. Such approaches of the deep learning models integrating soil–environmental relationships under limited parameterization and computing costs can serve as a baseline study, emphasizing opportunities in increasing the transferability and generalizability of the model while accounting for the associated environmental dependencies.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predicting Wind Turbine (WT) power output based on environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Along with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the following ML models were looked at: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). Using a dataset of 40,000 observations, the models were assessed based on R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). ET achieved the highest performance among ML models, with an R-squared value of 0.7231 and a RMSE of 0.1512. Among DL models, ANN demonstrated the best performance, achieving an R-squared value of 0.7248 and a RMSE of 0.1516. The results show that DL models, especially ANN, did slightly better than the best ML models. This means that they are better at modeling non-linear dependencies in multivariate data. Preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and parameter tuning, improved model performance by enhancing data consistency and optimizing hyperparameters. When compared to previous benchmarks, the performance of both ANN and ET demonstrates significant predictive accuracy gains in WT power output forecasting. This study’s novelty lies in directly comparing a diverse range of ML and DL algorithms while highlighting the potential of advanced computational approaches for renewable energy optimization.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition is an advanced version of an artificial emotional intelligence system. Various solutions have been proposed to enhance the performance and emotion recognition rate. Multimodal is also one of the recent advanced research areas to classify and recognize emotions in realtime, consisting of physiological signals, facial expressions, audio-visual, audio-text, and video-text fusion. The proposed work uses advanced deep learning models to recognize the seven categorical emotions from the audio and video modality. Different modalities' feature extraction techniques and landmarks, such as Audio and Video, play a vital role in recognizing emotions. It also illustrates the Audio-video-based feature fusion mechanism. It computes the complementary relationship between the different modalities and shows the improved performance using the RESNET20 model for audio modality and the 3DCNN model for video modality on the RAVDESS dataset. Opensmile toolkit is used to extract the compelling features from the audio model and fuse them with extracted features of video modality. Feature fusion mechanism fuses the extracted features of audio and video data to classify and enhance the accuracy of recognized categorical emotions. It also briefly discusses the various audio-video features fusion approaches, computational accuracy and robustness of the proposed model. It shows a result of 71.3% and 69.7%. Accuracy on validation and test datasets outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the multimodal emotion recognition domain with a fusion mechanism.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "As a key technique for future networks, the performance of emerging multi-edge caching is often limited by inefficient collaboration among edge nodes and improper resource configuration. Meanwhile, achieving optimal cache hit rates poses substantive challenges without effectively capturing the potential relations between discrete user features and diverse content libraries. These challenges become further sophisticated when caching schemes are exposed to adversarial attacks that seriously impair cache performance. To address these challenges, we introduce RoCoCache, a resilient collaborative caching framework that uniquely integrates robust federated deep learning with proactive caching strategies, enhancing performance under adversarial conditions. First, we design a novel partitioning mechanism for multi-dimensional cache space, enabling precise content recommendations in user classification intervals. Next, we develop a new Discrete-Categorical Variational Auto-Encoder (DC-VAE) to accurately predict content popularity by overcoming posterior collapse. Finally, we create an original training mode and proactive cache replacement strategy based on robust federated deep learning. Notably, the residual-based detection for adversarial model updates and similarity-based federated aggregation are integrated to avoid the model destruction caused by adversarial updates, which enables the proactive cache replacement adapting to optimized cache resources and thus enhances cache performance. Using the real-world testbed and datasets, extensive experiments verify that the RoCoCache achieves higher cache hit rates and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods while ensuring better robustness. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the components designed in RoCoCache for improving cache performance via ablation studies.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we attempted to classify categorical emotional states using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals and a configurable Convolutional Neural Network (cCNN). The EDA signals from the publicly available, Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion dataset were down-sampled and decomposed into phasic components using the cvxEDA algorithm. The phasic component of EDA was subjected to Short-Time Fourier Transform-based time-frequency representation to obtain spectrograms. These spectrograms were input to the proposed cCNN to automatically learn the prominent features and discriminate varied emotions such as amusing, boring, relaxing, and scary. Nested k-Fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results indicated that the proposed pipeline could discriminate the considered emotional states with a high average classification accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and F-measure scores of 80.20%, 60.41%, 86.8%, 60.05%, and 58.61%, respectively. Thus, the proposed pipeline could be valuable in examining diverse emotional states in normal and clinical conditions.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.",

We develop the theory of persistence categories as a natural generalization of persistence modules, establishing functorial relationships between classical topological invariants and their persistent counterparts. Our approach reveals deep connections between sheaf cohomology, spectral sequences, and multi-parameter persistence, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the stability and structure of topological features in data. We prove that persistent homology can be viewed as a particular instance of a more general categorical construction that encompasses both classical and computational topology. Furthermore, we establish new stability theorems for categorical persistence and demonstrate how classical results in algebraic topology can be lifted to the persistent setting through appropriate functorial constructions. We present practical applications in data science, computational biology, and machine learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our theoretical framework through concrete implementations and computational experiments.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Experimental results reveal that rocking shallow foundations reduce earthquake-induced force and flexural displacement demands transmitted to structures and can be used as an effective geotechnical seismic isolation mechanism. This paper presents data-driven predictive models for maximum acceleration transmitted to structures founded on rocking shallow foundations during earthquake loading. Results from base-shaking experiments on rocking foundations have been utilized for the development of artificial neural network regression (ANN), k-nearest neighbors regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, adaptive boosting regression, and gradient boosting regression models. Acceleration amplification ratio, defined as the maximum acceleration at the center of gravity of a structure divided by the peak ground acceleration of the earthquake, is considered as the prediction parameter. For five out of six models developed in this study, the overall mean absolute percentage error in predictions in repeated k-fold cross validation tests vary between 0.128 and 0.145, with the ANN model being the most accurate and most consistent. The cross validation mean absolute error in predictions of all six models vary between 0.08 and 0.1, indicating that the maximum acceleration of structures supported by rocking foundations can be predicted within an average error limit of 8% to 10% of the peak ground acceleration of the earthquake.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Physiological measurements have been widely used by researchers and practitioners in order to address the stress detection challenge. So far, various datasets for stress detection have been recorded and are available to the research community for testing and benchmarking. The majority of the stress-related available datasets have been recorded while users were exposed to intense stressors, such as songs, movie clips, major hardware/software failures, image datasets, and gaming scenarios. However, it remains an open research question if such datasets can be used for creating models that will effectively detect stress in different contexts. This paper investigates the performance of the publicly available physiological dataset named WESAD (wearable stress and affect detection) in the context of user experience (UX) evaluation. More specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) and skin temperature (ST) signals from WESAD were used in order to train three traditional machine learning classifiers and a simple feed forward deep learning artificial neural network combining continues variables and entity embeddings. Regarding the binary classification problem (stress vs. no stress), high accuracy (up to 97.4%), for both training approaches (deep-learning, machine learning), was achieved. Regarding the stress detection effectiveness of the created models in another context, such as user experience (UX) evaluation, the results were quite impressive. More specifically, the deep-learning model achieved a rather high agreement when a user-annotated dataset was used for validation.",

This study focuses on the objectives of computer vision systems: replicating human visual capabilities including recognition, comprehension, and interpretation. Notably, image classification, object detection, and image segmentation are crucial tasks requiring robust mathematical foundations. Despite the advancements, challenges persist, such as clarifying terminology related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Precise definitions and interpretations are vital for establishing a solid research foundation. The evolution of machine vision reflects an ambitious journey to emulate human visual perception.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules. The term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced by computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by identity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of its semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of encoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and properties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt Richard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We prove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural 2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the semantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map 2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified by Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we obtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises Garner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the interpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is well-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a semantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not admissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types but does not believe intensional ones.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Using dependent type theory to formalise the syntax of dependent type theory is a very active topic of study and goes under the name of \"type theory eating itself\" or \"type theory in type theory.\" Most approaches are at least loosely based on Dybjer’s categories with families (CwF’s) and come with a type Con of contexts, a type family Ty indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This works well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity proofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a long-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory \"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying difficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type theory in the absence of UIP.In this paper, we develop a notion of ∞-categories with families (∞-CwF’s). The approach to higher categories used relies on the previously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity substitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The type-theoretic universe as well as the internalised (set-level) syntax are models, although it remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known unsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is presented in two-level type theory (2LTT).Apart from introducing ∞-CwF’s, the paper explains the shortcomings of 1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and approaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

    "title": "Foundations of Substructural Dependent Type Theory",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This paper presents preliminary work on a general system for integrating dependent types into substructural type systems such as linear logic and linear type theory. Prior work on this front has generally managed to deliver type systems possessing either syntax or semantics inclusive of certain practical applications, but has struggled to combine these all in one and the same system. Toward resolving this difficulty, I propose a novel categorical interpretation of substructural dependent types, analogous to the use of monoidal categories as models of linear and ordered logic, that encompasses a wide class of mathematical and computational examples. On this basis, I develop a general framework for substructural dependent type theories, and proceed to prove some essential metatheoretic properties thereof. As an application of this framework, I show how it can be used to construct a type theory that satisfactorily addresses the problem of effectively representing cut admissibility for linear sequent calculus in a logical framework.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Using dependent type theory to formalise the syntax of dependent type theory is a very active topic of study and goes under the name of\"type theory eating itself\"or\"type theory in type theory.\"Most approaches are at least loosely based on Dybjer's categories with families (CwF's) and come with a type CON of contexts, a type family TY indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This works well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity proofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a long-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\"eats itself\"and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying difficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type theory in the absence of UIP. In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families ($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the previously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity substitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The type-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although it remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known unsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is presented in two-level type theory (2LTT). Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, this paper is meant to serve as a\"gentle introduction\"to shortcomings of 1-categories in type theory without UIP, and to difficulties of and approaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [28] constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "\n Locally cartesian closed (lcc) categories are natural categorical models of extensional dependent type theory. This paper introduces the “gros” semantics in the category of lcc categories: Instead of constructing an interpretation in a given individual lcc category, we show that also the category of all lcc categories can be endowed with the structure of a model of dependent type theory. The original interpretation in an individual lcc category can then be recovered by slicing. As in the original interpretation, we face the issue of coherence: Categorical structure is usually preserved by functors only up to isomorphism, whereas syntactic substitution commutes strictly with all type-theoretic structures. Our solution involves a suitable presentation of the higher category of lcc categories as model category. To that end, we construct a model category of lcc sketches, from which we obtain by the formalism of algebraically (co)fibrant objects model categories of strict lcc categories and then algebraically cofibrant strict lcc categories. The latter is our model of dependent type theory.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The metatheory of dependent types has seen a lot of progress in recent years. In particular, the development of categorical gluing finally lets us work with semantic presentations of type theory (such as categories with families) to establish fundamental properties of type theory such as canonicity and normalisation. However, proofs by gluing have yet to reach the stage of computer formalisation: formal proofs for the metatheory of dependent types are still stuck in the age of tedious syntactic proofs. The main reason for this is that semantic presentations of type theory are defined using sophisticated indexed inductive types, which are especially prone to \"transport hell\". In this paper, we introduce a new technique to work with CwFs in intensional type theory without getting stuck in transport hell. More specifically, we construct an alternative presentation of the initial CwF which encodes the substitutions as metatheoretical functions. This has the effect of strictifying all the equations that are involved in the substitution calculus, which greatly reduces the need for transports. As an application, we use our strictified initial CwF to give a short and elegant proof of canonicity for a type theory with dependent products and booleans with large elimination. The resulting proof is fully formalised in Agda.",

    "abstract": "The program of internal type theory seeks to develop the categorical model theory of dependent type theory using the language of dependent type theory itself. In the present work we study internal homotopical type theory by relaxing the notion of a category with families (cwf) to that of a wild, or precoherent higher cwf, and determine coherence conditions that suffice to recover properties expected of models of dependent type theory. The result is a definition of a split 2-coherent wild cwf, which admits as instances both the syntax and the\"standard model\"given by a universe type. This will allow us to give a straightforward internalization of the notion of a 2-coherent reflection of homotopical type theory in itself: namely as a 2-coherent wild cwf morphism from the syntax to the standard model. Our theory also easily specializes to give definitions of\"low-dimensional\"higher cwfs, and conjecturally includes the container higher model as a further instance.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \\emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \\emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \\emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze and compare three of the many algebraic structures that have been used for modeling dependent type theories: categories with families, split type-categories, and representable maps of presheaves. We study these in univalent type theory, where the comparisons between them can be given more elementarily than in set-theoretic foundations. Specifically, we construct maps between the various types of structures, and show that assuming the Univalence axiom, some of the comparisons are equivalences. We then analyze how these structures transfer along (weak and strong) equivalences of categories, and, in particular, show how they descend from a category (not assumed univalent/saturated) to its Rezk completion. To this end, we introduce relative universes, generalizing the preceding notions, and study the transfer of such relative universes along suitable structure. We work throughout in (intensional) dependent type theory; some results, but not all, assume the univalence axiom.

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "We develop a dependent type theory that is based purely on inductive and coinductive types, and the corresponding recursion and corecursion principles. This results in a type theory with a small set of rules, while still being fairly expressive. For example, all well-known basic types and type formers that are needed for using this type theory as a logic are definable: propositional connectives, like falsity, conjunction, disjunction, and function space, dependent function space, existential quantification, equality, natural numbers, vectors etc. The reduction relation on terms consists solely of a rule for recursion and a rule for corecursion. The reduction relations for well-known types arise from that. To further support the introduction of this new type theory, we also prove fundamental properties of its term calculus. Most importantly, we prove subject reduction and strong normalisation of the reduction relation, which gives computational meaning to the terms.The presented type theory is based on ideas from categorical logic that have been investigated before by the first author, and it extends Hagino’s categorical data types to a dependently typed setting. By basing the type theory on concepts from category theory we maintain the duality between inductive and coinductive types, and it allows us to describe, for example, the function space as a coinductive type.",

A (co)monad is determined by an adjunction and further determines a specific type of adjunction called the (co)Kleisli adjunction. Mac Lane introduced the comparison theorem which allows comparing these adjunctions bridged by a (co)monad through a unique comparison functor. In this paper we specify the foundations of category theory in Coq and show that the chosen representations are useful by certifying Mac Lane’s comparison theorem and its basic consequences. We also show that the foundations we use are equivalent to the foundations by Timany. The formalization makes use of Coq classes to implement categorical objects and the axiom uniqueness of identity proofs to close the gap between the contextual equality of objects in a categorical setting and the judgmental Leibniz equality of Coq. The theorem is used by Duval and Jacobs in their categorical settings to interpret the state effect in impure programming languages.",

Our topic is a theory showing “where adjoints come from”. The theory is based on object-to-object “chimera morphisms”, “heteromorphisms”, or “hets” between the objects of different categories (e.g., the insertion of generators as a set-to-group map). After showing that heteromorphisms can be treated rigorously using the machinery of category theory (bifunctors), we show that all adjunctions between two categories arise (up to an isomorphism) as the representations (i.e., universal models) within each category of the heteromorphisms between the two categories. The conventional treatment of adjunctions eschews the whole concept of a heteromorphism, so our purpose is to shine a new light on this notion by showing its origin as a het between categories being universally represented within each of the two categories. This heteromorphic treatment of adjunctions shows how they can be split into two separable universal constructions. Such universals can also occur without being part of an adjunction. We conclude with the idea that it is the universal constructions (adjunctions being an important special case) that are really the foundational concepts to pick out what is important in mathematics and perhaps in other sciences, not to mention in philosophy.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Traditional category theory is typically based on set-theoretic principles and ideas, which are often non-constructive. An alternative approach to formalizing category theory is to use E-category theory, where hom sets become setoids. Our work reconsiders a third approach - P-category theory - from \\v{C}ubri\\'c et al. (1998) emphasizing a computational standpoint. We formalize in Rocq a modest library of P-category theory - where homs become subsetoids - and apply it to formalizing algorithms for normalization by evaluation which are purely categorical but, surprisingly, do not use neutral and normal terms. \\v{C}ubri\\'c et al. (1998) establish only a soundness correctness property by categorical means; here, we extend their work by providing a categorical proof also for a strong completeness property. For this we formalize the full universal property of the free Cartesian-closed category, which is not known to have been performed before. We further formalize a novel universal property of unquotiented simply typed lambda-calculus syntax and apply this to a proof of correctness of a categorical normalization by evaluation algorithm. We pair the overall mathematical development with a formalization in the Rocq proof assistant, following the principle that the formalization exists for practical computation. Indeed, it permits extraction of synthesized normalization programs that compute (long) beta-eta-normal forms of simply typed lambda-terms together with a derivation of beta-eta-conversion.",

We explore the foundational methodologies of the Token Space, detailing its construction, the role of construction operators and initial categories, and its application in analyzing deep learning models, specifically focusing on attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures. The integration of category theory into AI research offers a unified framework to describe and analyze computational structures, enabling new research paths and development possibilities.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The growing complexity of modern practical problems puts high demand on mathematical modelling. Given that various models can be used for modelling one physical phenomenon, the role of model comparison and model choice is becoming particularly important. Methods for model comparison and model choice typically used in practical applications nowadays are computation-based, and thus time consuming and computationally costly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other approaches to working abstractly, i.e., without computations, with mathematical models. An abstract description of mathematical models can be achieved by the help of abstract mathematics, implying formalisation of models and relations between them. In this paper, a category theory-based approach to mathematical modelling is proposed. In this way, mathematical models are formalised in the language of categories, relations between the models are formally defined and several practically relevant properties are introduced on the level of categories. Finally, an illustrative example is presented, underlying how the category-theory based approach can be used in practice. Further, all constructions presented in this paper are also discussed from a modelling point of view by making explicit the link to concrete modelling scenarios.",

We show that string diagrams are also useful in exploring fundamental properties of basic concepts in category theory, such as universal properties, (co)limits, Kan extensions, and (co)ends. For instance, string diagrams are utilized to represent visually intuitive proofs of the Yoneda lemma, necessary and sufficient conditions for being adjunctions, the fact that right adjoints preserve limits (RAPL), and necessary and sufficient conditions for having pointwise Kan extensions. We also introduce a method for intuitively calculating (co)ends using diagrammatic representations and employ it to prove several properties of (co)ends and weighted (co)limits. This paper proposes that using string diagrams is an effective approach for beginners in category theory to learn the fundamentals of the subject in an intuitive and understandable way.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical morphology contributes many profitable tools to image processing area. Some of these methods considered to be basic but the most important fundamental of data processing in many various applications. In this paper, we modify the fundamental of morphological operations such as dilation and erosion making use of limit and co-limit preserving functors within (Category Theory). Adopting the well-known matrix representation of images, the category of matrix, called Mat, can be represented as an image. With enriching Mat over various semirings such as Boolean and (max,+) semirings, one can arrive at classical definition of binary and gray-scale images using the categorical tensor product in Mat. With dilation operation in hand, the erosion can be reached using the famous tensor-hom adjunction. This approach enables us to define new types of dilation and erosion between two images represented by matrices using different semirings other than Boolean and (max,+) semirings. The viewpoint of morphological operations from category theory can also shed light to the claimed concept that mathematical morphology is a model for linear logic.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks. The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries. The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Optics and lenses are abstract categorical gadgets that model systems with bidirectional data flow. In this paper we observe that the denotational definition of optics - identifying two optics as equivalent by observing their behaviour from the outside - is not suitable for operational, software oriented approaches where optics are not merely observed, but built with their internal setups in mind. We identify operational differences between denotationally isomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different composition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at two opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing categorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level, showing that the relevant operational concerns become visible. We define the 2-category $\\textbf{2-Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ whose 2-cells explicitly track optics' internal configuration. We show that the 1-category $\\textbf{Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ arises by locally quotienting out the connected components of this 2-category. We show that the embedding of lenses into cartesian optics gets weakened from a functor to an oplax functor whose oplaxator now detects the different composition rule. We determine the difficulties in showing this functor forms a part of an adjunction in any of the standard 2-categories. We establish a conjecture that the well-known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises out of the lax 2-adjunction between their double-categorical counterparts. In addition to presenting new research, this paper is also meant to be an accessible introduction to the topic.",

    "abstract": "Most texts on Category Theory are written in a very terse style, in which people pretend a) that all concepts are visualizable, and b) that the readers can reconstruct the diagrams that the authors had in mind based on only the most essential cues. As an outsider I spent years be-lieving that the techniques for drawing diagrams were part of the oral culture of the ﬁeld, and that the insiders could read texts on CT reconstructing the “missing diagrams” in them line by line and paragraph by paragraph, and drawing for each page of text a page of diagrams with all the diagrams that the authors had omitted. My belief was wrong: there are lots of conventions for drawing diagrams scattered through the literature, but that uniﬁed diagrammatic language did not exist. In this chapter I will show an attempt to reconstruct that (imaginary) language for missing diagrams: we will see an extensible diagrammatic language, called DL, that follows the conventions of the diagrams in the literature of CT whenever possible and that seems to be adequate for drawing “missing diagrams” for Category Theory. Our examples include the “missing diagrams” for adjunctions, for the Yoneda Lemma, for Kan extensions, and for geometric morphisms, and how to formalize them in Agda.",

This extends the previous results of Houston in the symmetric case, and addresses a question of his. It also extends the results in the non-symmetric case with additional finiteness assumptions, obtained by Benson–Etingof–Ostrik, Coulembier, and Ko–Mazorchuk–Zhang. We give an interpretation of these results using comonad cohomology, and, in the absence of finiteness conditions, using enriched traces of monoidal categories. As an application of our results, we give a characterization of finite tensor categories in terms of the finitary $2$-representation theory of Mazorchuk–Miemietz.",

    "abstract": "Univalence was first defined in the setting of homotopy type theory by Voevodsky, who also (along with Kapulkin and Lumsdaine) adapted it to a model categorical setting, which was subsequently generalized to locally Cartesian closed presentable $\\infty$-categories by Gepner and Kock. These definitions were used to characterize various $\\infty$-categories as models of type theories. We give a definition for univalent morphisms in finitely complete $\\infty$-categories that generalizes the aforementioned definitions and completely focuses on the $\\infty$-categorical aspects, characterizing it via representability of certain functors, which should remind the reader of concepts such as adjunctions or limits. \nWe then prove that in a locally Cartesian closed $\\infty$-category (that is not necessarily presentable) univalence of a morphism is equivalent to the completeness of a certain Segal object we construct out of the morphism, characterizing univalence via internal $\\infty$-categories, which had been considered in a strict setting by Stenzel. We use these results to study the connection between univalence and elementary topos theory. We also study univalent morphisms in the category of groups, the $\\infty$-category of $\\infty$-categories, and pointed $\\infty$-categories.",

    "abstract": "\n Given a differentially graded (DG)-category ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$, we introduce the bar category of modules ${\\overline{\\textbf{{Mod}}}-{\\mathcal{A}}}$. It is a DG enhancement of the derived category $D({{\\mathcal{A}}})$ of ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$, which is isomorphic to the category of DG ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$-modules with ${A_{\\infty }}$-morphisms between them. However, it is defined intrinsically in the language of DG categories and requires no complex machinery or sign conventions of ${A_{\\infty }}$-categories. We define for these bar categories Tensor and Hom bifunctors, dualisation functors, and a convolution of twisted complexes. The intended application is to working with DG-bimodules as enhancements of exact functors between triangulated categories. As a demonstration, we develop a homotopy adjunction theory for tensor functors between derived categories of DG categories. It allows us to show in an enhanced setting that given a functor $F$ with left and right adjoints $L$ and $R$, the functorial complex $FR \\xrightarrow{F{\\operatorname{act}}{R}} FRFR \\xrightarrow{FR{\\operatorname{tr}} - {\\operatorname{tr}}{FR}} FR \\xrightarrow{{\\operatorname{tr}}} {\\operatorname{Id}}$ lifts to a canonical twisted complex whose convolution is the square of the spherical twist of $F$.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous research has demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures exhibit categorical perception (CP) in their judgments of emotional faces. However, the extent to which this phenomenon characterises the judgments of facial expressions among East Asians remains relatively unexplored. Building upon recent findings showing that East Asians are more likely than Westerners to see a mixture of emotions in facial expressions of anger and disgust, the present research aimed to investigate whether East Asians also display CP for angry and disgusted faces. To address this question, participants from Canada and China were recruited to discriminate pairs of faces along the anger-disgust continuum. The results revealed the presence of CP in both cultural groups, as participants consistently exhibited higher accuracy and faster response latencies when discriminating between-category pairs of expressions compared to within-category pairs. Moreover, the magnitude of CP did not vary significantly across cultures. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the existence of CP for facial expressions in both East Asian and Western cultures, suggesting that CP is a perceptual phenomenon that transcends cultural boundaries. This research contributes to the growing literature on cross-cultural perceptions of facial expressions by deepening our understanding of how facial expressions are perceived categorically across cultures.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nCategorical perception (CP) manifests in various aspects of human cognition. While there is mounting evidence for CP in facial emotions, CP in vocal emotions remains understudied. The current study attempted to test whether individuals with a tonal language background perceive vocal emotions categorically and to examine how factors such as gender and age influence the plasticity of these perceptual categories.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis study examined the identification and discrimination performance of 24 Mandarin-speaking children (14 boys and 10 girls) and 32 adults (16 males and 16 females) when they were presented with three vocal emotion continua. Speech stimuli in each continuum consisted of 11 resynthesized Mandarin disyllabic words.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCP phenomena were detected when Mandarin participants perceived vocal emotions. We further found the modulating effect of age and gender in vocal emotion categorization.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results demonstrate for the first time that a categorical strategy is used by Mandarin speakers when perceiving vocal emotions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the categorization ability of vocal emotions follows a prolonged course of development and the maturation patterns differ across genders. This study opens a promising line of research for investigating how sensory features are mapped to higher order perception and provides implications for our understanding of clinical populations characterized by altered emotional processing.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27204057.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We intended to establish if two lexical tone contrasts in Zhumadian Mandarin, one between early and late aligned falls and another between early and late aligned rises, are perceived categorically, while the difference between declarative and interrogative pronunciations of these four tones is perceived gradiently. Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast. This conclusion challenges assumptions about the relation between linguistic functions and linguistic structures.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Categorical perception (CP) effects manifest as faster or more accurate discrimination between objects that come from different categories compared with objects that come from the same category, controlling for the physical differences between the objects. The most popular explanations of CP effects have relied on perceptual warping causing stimuli near a category boundary to appear more similar to stimuli within their own category and/or less similar to stimuli from other categories. Hanley and Roberson (2011), on the basis of a pattern not previously noticed in CP experiments, proposed an explanation of CP effects that relies not on perceptual warping, but instead on inconsistent usage of category labels. Experiments 1 and 2 in this article show a pattern opposite the one Hanley and Roberson pointed out. Experiment 3, using the same stimuli but with different choice statistics (i.e., different probabilities of each face being the target), obtains the same pattern as the one Hanley and Roberson showed. Simulations show that both category label and perceptual models are able to reproduce the patterns of results from both experiments, provided they include information about the choice statistics. This suggests 2 conclusions. First, the results described by Hanley and Roberson should not be taken as evidence in favor of a category label model. Second, given that participants did not receive feedback on their choices, there must be some mechanism by which participants monitor their own choices and adapt to the choice statistics present in the experiment.

There are several hypotheses about the causes of CP (e.g., language, learning, evolution) but no functional model.

We provide a model for learning-induced CP as expansion and compression of distances in hidden-unit space in neural nets. Basic conditions from which the current model predicts CP are described, and clues as to how these conditions might generalize to more complex kinds of categorization begin to emerge.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In Indonesia’s rapidly expanding cosmetic market, local brands face the dual challenge of competing with global beauty giants while appealing to increasingly identity-conscious consumers. This study investigates the drivers of purchase intention toward local cosmetic brands by integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Identity Theory (SIT), and Categorical Cognition Theory (CCT). Using data from 250 young Indonesian consumers and structural equation modeling, the study examines how Home Country Image (HCI) and Consumer Ethnocentrism (CE) influence purchase intention through Brand Image (BI), Product Belief (PB), and Attitude (ATT). Results reveal that HCI and CE significantly shape BI, PB, and ATT, but their influence on purchase intention is only realized when consumers hold strong beliefs in product quality. Surprisingly, brand image does not directly affect intention, challenging conventional wisdom in cosmetic marketing. This study contributes a novel multidimensional framework for understanding local brand loyalty in emerging markets and offers actionable insights for enhancing trust, cultural relevance, and competitiveness in the Indonesian beauty industry.",

    "year": 2010,
    "abstract": "Classical and Connectionist theories of cognitive architecture seek to explain systematicity (i.e., the property of human cognition whereby cognitive capacity comes in groups of related behaviours) as a consequence of syntactically and functionally compositional representations, respectively. However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific instances of these forms of compositionality (e.g. grammars, networks) that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptolemaic (i.e. geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to fully explain it. Category theory, a branch of mathematics, provides an alternative explanation based on the formal concept of adjunction, which relates a pair of structure-preserving maps, called functors. A functor generalizes the notion of a map between representational states to include a map between state transformations (or processes). In a formal sense, systematicity is a necessary consequence of a higher-order theory of cognitive architecture, in contrast to the first-order theories derived from Classicism or Connectionism. Category theory offers a re-conceptualization for cognitive science, analogous to the one that Copernicus provided for astronomy, where representational states are no longer the center of the cognitive universe—replaced by the relationships between the maps that transform them.",

    "year": 2011,
    "abstract": "A complete theory of cognitive architecture (i.e., the basic processes and modes of composition that together constitute cognitive behaviour) must explain the systematicity property—why our cognitive capacities are organized into particular groups of capacities, rather than some other, arbitrary collection. The classical account supposes: (1) syntactically compositional representations; and (2) processes that are sensitive to—compatible with—their structure. Classical compositionality, however, does not explain why these two components must be compatible; they are only compatible by the ad hoc assumption (convention) of employing the same mode of (concatenative) compositionality (e.g., prefix/postfix, where a relation symbol is always prepended/appended to the symbols for the related entities). Architectures employing mixed modes do not support systematicity. Recently, we proposed an alternative explanation without ad hoc assumptions, using category theory. Here, we extend our explanation to domains that are quasi-systematic (e.g., aspects of most languages), where the domain includes some but not all possible combinations of constituents. The central category-theoretic construct is an adjunction involving pullbacks, where the primary focus is on the relationship between processes modelled as functors, rather than the representations. A functor is a structure-preserving map (or construction, for our purposes). An adjunction guarantees that the only pairings of functors are the systematic ones. Thus, (quasi-)systematicity is a necessary consequence of a categorial cognitive architecture whose basic processes are functors that participate in adjunctions.",

There are many useful applications for this theory in cognitive science, and we want to introduce one such application to a broader audience. CT and the concepts used in this paper are introduced and explained. We show how the category theoretical concepts product and pullback can be used with the category of colored multigraphs to find possible analogies between domains using different requirements. The dual notion of a pullback, the pushout, is then used as conceptual blending to generate a new domain.",

While this article is by no means a comprehensive report on that event, the popularity of “Cats for AI” — the five introductory lectures on cats.for.ai have been viewed thousands of times — signals the growing prevalence of category theoretic tools in AI. One place where category theory is gaining traction in machine learning is by providing a formal way to discuss how learning systems can be put together. This article has a different and somewhat narrow focus. It’s about how a fundamental piece of AI technology used in language modeling can be understood, with the aid of categorical thinking, as a process that extracts structural features of language from purely syntactical input.

By extending these local categories into a unified two-category enriched with natural isomorphisms, the universal properties of logical operations such as negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication are rigorously captured. Advanced techniques including pseudo-limits, pseudo-colimits, and strictification are employed to transform the resulting weak structure into a strict two-category, thereby simplifying composition rules and coherence verification without loss of semantic content. The framework is validated through detailed diagrammatic proofs and concrete examples, demonstrating its robustness and potential impact in areas such as type theory, programming language semantics, and formal verification.",

    "abstract": "We develop foundations for oriented category theory, an extension of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-category theory obtained by systematic usage of the Gray tensor product, in order to study lax phenomena in higher category theory. As categorical dimension increases, classical category-theoretic concepts generally prove too rigid or fully break down and must be replaced by oriented versions, which allow more flexible notions of naturality and coherence. Oriented category theory provides a framework to address these issues. The main objects of study are oriented, and their conjugate antioriented, categories, which are deformations of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories where the various compositions only commute up to a coherent (anti)oriented interchange law. We give a geometric description of (anti)oriented categories as sheaves on a deformation of the simplex category $\\Delta$ in which the linear graphs are weighted by (anti)oriented cubes. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show that the categorical analogues of fundamental constructions in homotopy theory, such as cylinder and path objects, join and slice, and suspension and loops, are not functors of $(\\infty, \\infty)$-categories, but only of (anti)oriented categories, generalizing work of Ara, Guetta, and Maltsiniotis in the strict setting. As a main result we construct an embedding of the theory of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories into the theory of (anti)oriented categories and characterize the image, which we call (anti)oriented spaces. We provide an algebraic description of (anti)oriented spaces as (anti)oriented categories satisfying a strict (anti)oriented interchange law and a geometric description as sheaves on suitable categories of (anti)oriented polytopes, generalizing Grothendieck's philosophy of test categories to higher categorical dimension and refining Campion's work on lax cubes and suitable sites.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Network automation has become crucial in supporting services in 6G networks. This mainly derives from the complexity of the composition of numerous distributed virtual network functions (VNFs) in creating highly flexible virtual network services. Therefore, a network service automation system is a key technology enabler for 6G. However, the added complexity renders network service automation systems particularly sensitive to faults, some of which cause network outages that harm the smooth operation of basic societal services. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for fault detection can barely detect hidden faults. Herein, we propose a mechanism for automated network service analysis (ANSA), which constructs and analyzes a digital twin of a network service. The digital twin represents the available information about the network service based on category theory. It uses the properties of category theory to perform an analysis through which the faults of the network service are identified. We evaluate a prototype of a network service automation system that incorporates ANSA to demonstrate 1) the benefits of using digital twins for analyzing network services, 2) the benefits of using category theory for constructing digital twins of the network services, and 3) the resulting improvements in fault detection. Overall, ANSA can detect an average of 94% of the faults present in a network service. In comparison, previous SotA solutions can detect only 30%–50% of all faults.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The study of abstraction and composition - the focus of category theory - naturally leads to sophisticated diagrams which can encode complex algebraic semantics. Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems. Complex algebraic structures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we introduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communications (SC) offers a promising paradigm to amplify the resource efficiency of forthcoming wire-less systems by transmitting only messages that hold relevance to end users. Assessing the potential of SC systems necessitates a reevaluation of semantic information. Traditionally, semantic information has been confined to set-theoretic formulations, neglecting end users' deductive and abductive reasoning capacities. Contrary to the prior art, in this paper, a fresh framework for semantic information leveraging category theory and symbolic logic is introduced. In particular, we have proposed a neurosym-bolic artificial intelligence-based semantic communication (SC) system that encodes source data, represented as a set of logical statements, into a semantic representation. The symbolic component, structured as a first-order logical language, incorporates complex logical formulas designed to facilitate logical reasoning at the receiver nodes. Furthermore, a rigorous formulation of the semantics conveyed through the logical statements are developed through the concept of Fibrations. Finally, the mapping of the logical language onto a neural network space, while preserving the compositional structure of the language, is achieved using Grothendieck toposes in category theory. A novel formulation of semantic information is proposed, deriving it as the summation of represented information-which incorporates compositional knowledge enabled by the Grothendieck topos framework-and reasoned information.",

In this paper, we develop a compositional semantics for linearizable concurrent objects. We start by showcasing a common issue, which is independent of linearizability, in the construction of compositional models of concurrent computation: interaction with the neutral element for composition can lead to emergent behaviors, a hindrance to compositionality. Category theory provides a solution for the issue in the form of the Karoubi envelope. Surprisingly, and this is the main discovery of our work, this abstract construction is deeply related to linearizability and leads to a novel formulation of it. Notably, this new formulation neither relies on atomicity nor directly upon happens-before ordering and is only possible because of compositionality, revealing that linearizability and compositionality are intrinsically related to each other. We use this new, and compositional, understanding of linearizability to revisit much of the theory of linearizability, providing novel, simple, algebraic proofs of the locality property and of an analogue of the equivalence with observational refinement. We show our techniques can be used in practice by connecting our semantics with a simple program logic that is nonetheless sound concerning this generalized linearizability.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful, reconstructive approach. Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks, predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties. We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a research agenda for their unification.",

    "title": "Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: Debiasing Through Reconception",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Background: Cognitive biases are systematic errors in reasoning that can lead to inaccurate decision-making across all areas of software production, regardless of the domain, programming language, or development method. Given the central role of software across all sectors, such biases can result in largescale inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs. Goal: While prior software engineering (SE) research predominantly focuses on specific tasks and quantitative methods, the vision of this paper is to study qualitatively how cognitive biases emerge, persist, and can be mitigated to improve decision-making throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Method: This vision uniquely applies the concept of reconception as a theoretical lens to explore how software professionals' cognitive models influence their management of dialectical oppositions, such as project velocity vs product quality and open-source vs proprietary control. Utilising Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) and dialectical inquiry, it examines how reconceiving these oppositions affects cognitive models and decision-making processes. Expected Outcome: A broad and high-level theoretical framework that explains how selected cognitive biases influence SE decision-making across the SDLC. The framework is developed through a two-phase STGT process: identifying salient bias categories in the first phase and focusing on the role of specific biases in shaping decision patterns in the second. This highlevel theory will open new research opportunities for future investigations into bias-informed decision-making in SE. Conclusion: This theoretical framework will support the development of empirically grounded debiasing strategies for more reliable decision-making in software engineering.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in systems’ complexity, leading to a rise in the need for more and more models. Models created with different intents are written using different formalisms and give diverse system representations. This work focuses on the system engineering domain and its models. It is crucial to assert a critical system’s compliance with its requirements. Thus, multiple models dedicated to these assertions are designed, such as safety or multi-physics models. As those models are independent of the architecture model, we need to provide means to assert and maintain consistency between them if we want the analyses to be relevant. The model synchronization methodologies give means to work on the consistency between the models through steps of abstraction to a common formalism, comparison, and concretization of the comparison results in the original models. This paper proposes a mathematical framework that allows for a formal definition of such a consistency relation and a mathematical description of the models. We use the context of category theory, as this is a mathematical theory providing great tools for taking into account different abstraction levels and composition of relations. Finally, we show how this mathematical framework can be applied to a specific synchronization methodology with a realistic study case.",

    "title": "Taxonomy-Based Human Error Assessment for Senior Software Engineering Students",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Software engineering (SE) is a complex symphony of development activities spanning multiple engineering phases. Despite best efforts, software engineers experience human errors. Human error theory from psychology has been studied in the context of SE, but human error assessment has yet to be adopted as part of typical post-mortem activities in SE. Our goal in this work is to evaluate an existing Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.) as a learning tool for software engineering students. We conducted a user study involving five SE students at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In two experimental phases (17 weeks total), participants self-reported 162 human errors that they experienced during software development. Participants' feedback collected via surveys indicates that T.H.E.S.E. is clear, simple to use, and general to all phases of SE. Participants also indicated that human error assessment guided by T.H.E.S.E. (1) would benefit other students and professional software engineers and (2) enhanced their understanding of human errors in SE and of their own human errors. These are promising results indicating that human error assessment facilitated by T.H.E.S.E. is a valuable learning experience for software engineering students. We release anonymized survey responses and reported human errors. Future work should examine T.H.E.S.E. as a learning tool for professional software developers and examine other SE artifacts to identify categories of human error that are not presently captured by T.H.E.S.E.",

    "abstract": "Software engineering (SE) teaching includes different strategies such as project-based learning, collaborative learning, simulations, and case methods, among others, seeking to balance theory and practice and encourage teamwork. However, although some repositories of teaching practices are identified, each SE teacher incorporates different strategies/practices either barely documented or subjectively represented. The latter hinders the transfer of knowledge among the software engineering education community. Therefore, in this paper we propose SETMAT (Software Engineering Teaching Methods and Theory), a descriptive theory of SE education offering a common conceptual framework for representing software engineering teaching practices, and we also describe a pilot with teachers from Colombia, Chile, and Mexico where they represented and socialized their SE teaching practices in SETMAT. This pilot proves the usage of SETMAT for representing teaching practices easies comparison, composition, and transferring such practices. This poses an input of interest for SE education.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study addresses the urgent need for culturally informed educational technologies by proposing a web-based learning system designed to capture the rhythmic, tonal, and performative nuances of African music. Existing music software rarely accommodates Afrocentric elements such as ululation, call and response, and polyrhythmic layering, resulting in limited pedagogical effectiveness and the marginalization of Indigenous sonic knowledge. To bridge this gap, the research introduces a “musical engineering” framework that integrates Indigenous epistemologies into scoring algorithms and interactive learning modules. Guided by user-centered design, the Semiotic Theory of Music, and Episto Musical Pedagogy Theory, the study employs prototype development, usability testing, and contextual analysis. Findings show that African compositional idioms can be effectively encoded, represented, and taught through digital platforms when cultural logic informs system architecture. The resulting platform, AfriScore, supports notation, playback, and pedagogical feedback, offering a scalable model for music education and heritage preservation. Beyond safeguarding cultural knowledge, AfriScore demonstrates how embedding Indigenous epistemologies can enhance software functionality and user engagement, providing a replicable model for global educational technology design. Future research should examine cross-regional adaptation and integration into formal curricula.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Often in Software Engineering, a modeling formalism has to support scenarios of inconsistency in which several requirements either reinforce or contradict each other. Paraconsistent transition systems are proposed in this paper as one such formalism: states evolve through two accessibility relations capturing weighted evidence of a transition or its absence, respectively. Their weights come, parametrically, from a residuated lattice. This paper explores both i) a category of these systems, and the corresponding compositional operators and ii) a modal logic to reason upon them. Furthermore, two notions of crisp and graded simulation and bisimulation are introduced in order to relate two paraconsistent transition systems. Finally, results of modal invariance, for specific subsets of formulas, are discussed.",

It focuses on exploring how to guide students to utilize PRO/II in sensitivity analysis and systematically examine the key impacts of variables such as feed composition and operating pressure on separation efficiency and energy consumption. Teaching practice shows that this model can effectively cultivate students' engineering thinking, digital design capabilities, and comprehensive literacy in solving complex engineering problems, providing a valuable teaching plan for the cultivation of outstanding chemical engineers.",

    "title": "Design of Heterogeneous Cyber-Physical Systems Employing Category Theory",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous cyber-physical control systems based on digital twins are in demand by Industry 4.0. In accordance with the contemporary systems engineering methodology, such systems are designed at the level of digital models. The paper proposes approaches to formalization and subsequent automation of solving direct and inverse problems of their design. To unify descriptions of heterogeneous components, we follow a viewpoint-based approach to architecture design recommended by the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. Following recent trends, we employ category theory as a mathematical framework for the formal description and solution of design problems. Indeed, category theory is a branch of higher algebra specifically aimed at a unified representation of objects of different nature and relationships between them. The design space of a heterogeneous cyber-physical system is constructed as a subcategory of the multicomma category, the objects of which describe possible system architectures with a fixed structural hierarchy represented from a certain viewpoint as diagrams, and morphisms denote actions associated with the parts selection and replacement during the system design. Direct design problems consist in evaluating the properties of the system as a whole by its architecture and are solved using a universal category-theoretic construction of the colimit of the diagram. The solution of inverse problems that require finding variants of the system architecture, which are (sub-, Pareto-) optimal according to the consumer quality criteria, consists in reconstructing diagrams by their colimit edges. For such reconstruction, optimization algorithms of gradient descent type are reasonable to employ, which navigate along the system design space morphisms calculating the path by means of computer algebra. Typical techniques of assembling cyber-physical systems, such as modular composition and aspect weaving, are described in the language of category theory and illustrated. As an example, we outline the design of energy-efficient robotic production lines represented from the behavior viewpoint as discrete-event simulation models.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.",

MDE is a recent trend in software development, industrially supported by standards, tools, and the status of a new \"silver bullet\". Surprisingly, categorical patterns turn out to be directly applicable to mathematical modeling of structures appearing in everyday MDE practice. Model merging, transformation, synchronization, and other important model management scenarios can be seen as executions of categorical specifications. \nMoreover, the paper aims to elucidate a claim that relationships between CT and MDE are more complex and richer than is normally assumed for \"applied mathematics\". CT provides a toolbox of design patterns and structural principles of real practical value for MDE. We will present examples of how an elementary categorical arrangement of a model management scenario reveals deficiencies in the architecture of modern tools automating the scenario.",

    "abstract": "Software engineer is one of the highest in-demand manpower jobs in the world. As the prolonged COVID19 pandemic crisis, more and more people throughout the world became unemployed. There arises an incoming demand for reskilling and career shifting to software engineer. Online learning through MOOCs is, therefore, a viable and practical solution. However, reskilling to be a software engineer requires specific platform support that is able to develop both technical and non-technical skills, including management, communication, and teamwork, that traditional MOOCs cannot fulfill the challenges. This research aims to augment the traditional MOOCs with the additional use of personalization, collaboration, and gamification theory in the name of “CareerVio MOOCs Platform”. The distinct supports and services provided by the platform comprise team composition, team recomposition, team learning, and team assessments. CareerVio enables learners to master the necessary skills required in software engineer career, enhances the interaction between learners, and allows them to take what they have learned off the page and put it into practice.",

    "title": "The Human Side of Software Engineering Teams: An Investigation of Contemporary Challenges",
    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Context: There have been numerous recent calls for research on the human side of software engineering and its impact on various factors such as productivity, developer happiness and project success. An analysis of which challenges in software engineering teams are most frequent is still missing. As teams are more international, it is more frequent that their members have different human values as well as different communication habits. Additionally, virtual team setups (working geographically separated, remote communication using digital tools and frequently changing team members) are increasingly prevalent. Objective: We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about contemporary human challenges in teams and their causes in software engineering. To do so, we look to establish a reusable set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of members with different nationalities that may have more divergent human values due to cultural differences compared to single nationality teams. Method: We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ”within teams” as well as ”between teams and clients”, compiled from previous empirical work, blog posts, and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if mitigation measures were already in place to tackle the challenge. Respondents were also asked to provide information about their team setup. The survey included the Personal Value Questionnaire to measure Schwartz human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional challenges at their workplace. The survey was first piloted and then distributed to professionals working in software engineering teams via social networking sites and personal business networks. Result: In this article, we report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two categories of challenges; ”interpersonal” and ”intrapersonal”. We found no evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3 different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to increase the frequency of some human challenges, which warrants further research about how to improve working processes when teams work from remote or in a distributed fashion. Conclusion: We present a set of human challenges in software engineering that can be used for further research on causes and mitigation measures, which serves as our starting point for a theory about causes of contemporary human challenges in software engineering teams. We report on evidence that a higher degree of virtualization of teams leads to an increase of certain challenges. This warrants further research to gather more evidence and test countermeasures, such as whether the employment of virtual reality software incorporating facial expressions and movements can help establish a less detached way of communication.",

Different definitions and many attempts were made in order to shape one concrete definition that serves as a reference. In the midst of this struggle, we propose a new attempt to define the emergence phenomenon from a software engineering perspective. Whereas many fields study the phenomenon based on observation and report, software systems engineering includes the fact that we are not only observing but further participating in the creation of the system of interest, giving a different perspective in defining and understanding the phenomenon. In this paper, we propose both informal and formal definitions, discuss some characteristics and list categories of the emergent behavior and how can we harness such a behavior.",

We performed a high level analysis to discover common themes in such papers and discovered that GT had been applied primarily in three software engineering disciplines: agile development processes, geographically distributed software development, and requirements engineering. For each category, we collected and analyzed all grounded theory codes and created, following a GT analysis process, what we call metacodes that can be used to drive further theory building.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This position paper examines the substantial divide between academia and industry within quantum software engineering. For example, while academic research related to debugging and testing predominantly focuses on a limited subset of primarily quantum-specific issues, industry practitioners face a broader range of practical concerns, including software integration, compatibility, and real-world implementation hurdles. This disconnect mainly arises due to academia's limited access to industry practices and the often confidential, competitive nature of quantum development in commercial settings. As a result, academic advancements often fail to translate into actionable tools and methodologies that meet industry needs. By analyzing discussions within quantum developer forums, we identify key gaps in focus and resource availability that hinder progress on both sides. We propose collaborative efforts aimed at developing practical tools, methodologies, and best practices to bridge this divide, enabling academia to address the application-driven needs of industry and fostering a more aligned, sustainable ecosystem for quantum software development.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Incorporating responsible practices into Software Engineering (SE) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential to ensure ethical principles, societal impact, and accountability remain at the forefront of AI system design and deployment. This study investigates the ethical challenges and complexities inherent in Responsible Software Engineering (RSE) for AI, underscoring the need for practical, scenario-driven operational guidelines. Given the complexity of AI and the relative inexperience of professionals in this rapidly evolving field, continuous learning and market adaptation are crucial. Through qualitative interviews with seven practitioners (conducted until saturation), quantitative surveys of $\\mathbf{5 1}$ practitioners and static validation of results with four industry experts in AI, this study explores how personal values, emerging roles, and awareness of AI's societal impact influence responsible decision-making in RSE for AI. A key finding is the gap between the current state of the art and actual practice in RSE for AI, particularly in the failure to operationalize ethical and responsible decision-making within the Software Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) for AI. While ethical issues in RSE for AI largely mirror those found in broader SE process, the study highlights a distinct lack of operational frameworks and resources to guide RSE practices for AI effectively. The results reveal that current ethical guidelines are insufficiently implemented at the operational level, reinforcing the complexity of embedding ethics throughout the SELC. The study concludes that interdisciplinary collaboration, H-shaped competencies (Ethical-Technical dual competence), and a strong organizational culture of ethics are critical for fostering RSE practices for AI, with a particular focus on transparency and accountability.",

While some guidelines to address fairness have been proposed, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions on fairness in AI models is trick. This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize the current advancements in fairness solutions in software engineering, focusing on two key elements: research trends and focus. We develop a classification framework to organize research on Software Fairness in a new perspective, applying it to 83 selected studies. As main result, we have found that researchers are creating practical AI solutions—specifically, framework solutions— focusing on group fairness metrics during the post-processing stage, these solutions are predominantly integrated during implementation and testing phases in software engineering process, with less attention to early stages like planning and design. Our results indicate a need to include fairness considerations throughout all stages of the software development lifecycle. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, laying a foundation for guiding future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Empathy is a powerful yet often overlooked element in software engineering (SE), supporting better teamwork, smoother communication, and effective decision-making.This paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines designed to support practitioners, teams, and organisations. We also explore how these guidelines can be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications, challenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners. To support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that categorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of implementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and flexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping teams move from principles to sustainable action.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Large Language Models are transforming software engineering, yet prompt management in practice remains ad hoc, hindering reliability, reuse, and integration into industrial workflows. We present Prompt-with-Me, a practical solution for structured prompt management embedded directly in the development environment. The system automatically classifies prompts using a four-dimensional taxonomy that encompasses intent, author role, software development lifecycle stage, and prompt type. To improve prompt reuse and quality, Prompt-with-Me suggests language refinements, masks sensitive information, and extracts reusable templates from a developer’s prompt library.Our taxonomy study of 1,108 real-world prompts demonstrates that modern LLMs can accurately classify software engineering prompts. Furthermore, our user study with 11 participants shows strong developer acceptance, with high usability (Mean SUS=73), low cognitive load (Mean NASA-TLX=21), and reported gains in prompt quality and efficiency through reduced repetitive effort. Lastly, we offer actionable insights for building the next generation of prompt management and maintenance tools for software engineering workflows.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Empathy plays a crucial role in software engineering (SE), influencing collaboration, communication, and decision-making. While prior research has highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE activities where empathy is perceived as useful or less relevant, and the other factors that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.",

    "title": "Federated Learning for Software Engineering: A Case Study of Code Clone Detection and Defect Prediction",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "In various research domains, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence, leading to the development of numerous learning-based models in research laboratories, which are evaluated using benchmark datasets. While the models proposed in previous studies may demonstrate satisfactory performance on benchmark datasets, translating academic findings into practical applications for industry practitioners presents challenges. This can entail either the direct adoption of trained academic models into industrial applications, leading to a performance decrease, or retraining models with industrial data, a task often hindered by insufficient data instances or skewed data distributions. Real-world industrial data is typically significantly more intricate than benchmark datasets, frequently exhibiting data-skewing issues, such as label distribution skews and quantity skews. Furthermore, accessing industrial data, particularly source code, can prove challenging for Software Engineering (SE) researchers due to privacy policies. This limitation hinders SE researchers’ ability to gain insights into industry developers’ concerns and subsequently enhance their proposed models. To bridge the divide between academic models and industrial applications, we introduce a federated learning (FL)-based framework called Almity. Our aim is to simplify the process of implementing research findings into practical use for both SE researchers and industry developers. Almity enhances model performance on sensitive skewed data distributions while ensuring data privacy and security. It introduces an innovative aggregation strategy that takes into account three key attributes: data scale, data balance, and minority class learnability. This strategy is employed to refine model parameters, thereby enhancing model performance on sensitive skewed datasets. In our evaluation, we employ two well-established SE tasks, i.e., code clone detection and defect prediction, as evaluation tasks. We compare the performance of Almity on both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models against two mainstream training methods, specifically the Centralized Training Method (CTM) and Vanilla Federated Learning (VFL), to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of Almity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework is not only feasible but also practical in real-world scenarios. Almity consistently enhances the performance of learning-based models, outperforming baseline training methods across all types of data distributions.",

Through 16 reflective interviews with SE students, we explored their academic experiences of using genAI tools to complement SE learning and implementations. We uncover the contexts where these tools are helpful and where they pose challenges, along with examining why these challenges arise and how they impact students.

    "abstract": "Lawvere's algebraic theories, or Lawvere theories, underpin a categorical approach to general algebra, and Lawvere's adjunction between semantics and algebraic structure leads to an equivalence between Lawvere theories and finitary monads on the category of sets. Several authors have transported these ideas to a variety of settings, including contexts of category theory enriched in a symmetric monoidal closed category. In this paper, we develop a general axiomatic framework for enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities. Not only do we establish a simultaneous generalization of the monad-theory equivalences previously developed in the settings of Lawvere (1963), Linton (1966), Dubuc (1970), Borceux-Day (1980), Power (1999), Nishizawa-Power (2009), Lack-Rosick\\'y (2011), Lucyshyn-Wright (2016), and Bourke-Garner (2019), but also we establish a structure-semantics theorem that generalizes those given in the first four of these works while applying also to the remaining five, for which such a result has not previously been developed. Furthermore, we employ our axiomatic framework to establish broad new classes of examples of enriched monad-theory equivalences and structure-semantics adjunctions for subcategories of arities enriched in locally bounded closed categories, including various convenient closed categories that are relevant in topology and analysis and need not be locally presentable.",

    "abstract": "We develop a general framework for studying signatures, presentations, and algebraic colimits of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities, even when the base of enrichment $\\mathcal{V}$ is not locally presentable. When $\\mathcal{V}$ satisfies the weaker requirement of local boundedness, the resulting framework is sufficiently general to apply to the $\\Phi$-accessible monads of Lack and Rosick\\'y and the $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads of the first author, while even without local boundedness our framework captures in full generality the presentations of strongly finitary monads of Lack and Kelly as well as Wolff's presentations of $\\mathcal{V}$-categories by generators and relations. Given any small subcategory of arities $j : \\mathcal{J} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{C}$ in an enriched category $\\mathcal{C}$, satisfying certain assumptions, we prove results on the existence of free $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads, the monadicity of $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads over $\\mathcal{J}$-signatures, and the existence of algebraic colimits of $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads. We study a notion of presentation for $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads and show that every such presentation presents a $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monad. Certain of our results generalize earlier results of Kelly, Power, and Lack for finitary enriched monads in the locally finitely presentable setting, as well as analogous results of Kelly and Lack for strongly finitary monads on cartesian closed categories. Our main results hold for a wide class of subcategories of arities in locally bounded enriched categories.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "Under a minimum of assumptions, we develop in generality the basic theory of universal algebra in a symmetric monoidal closed category $\\mathcal{V}$ with respect to a specified system of arities $j:\\mathcal{J} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{V}$. Lawvere's notion of algebraic theory generalizes to this context, resulting in the notion of single-sorted $\\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\\mathcal{J}$-cotensor theory, or $\\mathcal{J}$-theory for short. For suitable choices of $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{J}$, such $\\mathcal{J}$-theories include the enriched algebraic theories of Borceux and Day, the enriched Lawvere theories of Power, the equational theories of Linton's 1965 work, and the $\\mathcal{V}$-theories of Dubuc, which are recovered by taking $\\mathcal{J} = \\mathcal{V}$ and correspond to arbitrary $\\mathcal{V}$-monads on $\\mathcal{V}$. We identify a modest condition on $j$ that entails that the $\\mathcal{V}$-category of $\\mathcal{T}$-algebras exists and is monadic over $\\mathcal{V}$ for every $\\mathcal{J}$-theory $\\mathcal{T}$, even when $\\mathcal{T}$ is not small and $\\mathcal{V}$ is neither complete nor cocomplete. We show that $j$ satisfies this condition if and only if $j$ presents $\\mathcal{V}$ as a free cocompletion of $\\mathcal{J}$ with respect to the weights for left Kan extensions along $j$, and so we call such systems of arities eleutheric. We show that $\\mathcal{J}$-theories for an eleutheric system may be equivalently described as (i) monads in a certain one-object bicategory of profunctors on $\\mathcal{J}$, and (ii) $\\mathcal{V}$-monads on $\\mathcal{V}$ satisfying a certain condition. We prove a characterization theorem for the categories of algebras of $\\mathcal{J}$-theories, considered as $\\mathcal{V}$-categories $\\mathcal{A}$ equipped with a specified $\\mathcal{V}$-functor $\\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter we discuss soft concept analysis, a study which identifies an enriched notion of \"conceptual scale\" as developed in formal concept analysis with an enriched notion of \"linguistic variable\" as discussed in fuzzy logic. The identification \"enriched conceptual scale\" = \"enriched linguistic variable\" was made in a previous paper (Enriched interpretation, Robert E. Kent). In this chapter we offer further arguments for the importance of this identification by discussing the philosophy, spirit, and practical application of conceptual scaling to the discovery, conceptual analysis, interpretation, and categorization of networked information resources. We argue that a linguistic variable, which has been defined at just the right generalization of valuated categories, provides a natural definition for the process of soft conceptual scaling. This enrichment using valuated categories models the relation of indiscernability, a notion of central importance in rough set theory. At a more fundamental level for soft concept analysis, it also models the derivation of formal concepts, a process of central importance in formal concept analysis. Soft concept analysis is synonymous with enriched concept analysis. From one viewpoint, the study of soft concept analysis that is initiated here extends formal concept analysis to soft computational structures. From another viewpoint, soft concept analysis provides a natural foundation for soft computation by unifying and explaining notions from soft computation in terms of suitably generalized notions from formal concept analysis, rough set theory and fuzzy set theory.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Selenium-rich foods play a crucial role in human health and hold significant economic value for agricultural products. However, many regions in China are experiencing selenium deficiency, which has led to an increased demand for Se-rich agricultural products. This study focused on Nanzhang County, a key area within the “Organic Valley” of Hubei Province, China. We employed fuzzy weights-of-evidence, backpropagation neural network, and support vector regression models to predict optimal planting zones for Selenium-rich crops. A comparative analysis indicated that the backpropagation neural network model provided the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.77), identifying Selenium-rich crop zones covering 68.87% of the aera, where Selenium-rich crops made up 86.67% of all samples. Notably, the backpropagation neural network yielded excellent performance for rice and rapeseed, with R2 values of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. The findings also indicate that the Selenium content in crops is closely linked to Selenium levels in the soil and is significantly influenced by synergistic and antagonistic interactions with other elements. This study provides scientific support for the cultivation of selenium-rich crops. It plays a positive role in promoting the development of the local selenium-rich industry and the sustainable utilization of soil selenium resources.",

I-SIMO converter provides both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) outputs from a single DC input source depending on the operation mode. It comprises two modes of operation, act as DC–DC converter in vehicle standby mode and DC–AC converter in vehicles driving mode.\n\n\nFindings\nThe use of PV panels in the vehicle helps to reduce dependence of grid supply as well as vehicle’s batteries. The proposed topology has to remove the multiple power conversion stages in EV system, reduce components count and provide dual outputs for enhancement of performance of EV system.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe proposed topology leads to reduction of switching losses and stresses across the components of the converter and provides reduction in system complexity and overall expenditure. So, it enhances the converter reliability and also improves the efficiency. The converter provides ripple-free output voltage under dynamic load condition. The performance of EET-FLC is studied by taking various performance measures such as rise time, peak time, settling time and peak overshoot and compared with conventional control designs.\n",

    "title": "Assessment and Validation of Shallow Groundwater Vulnerability to Contamination Based on Fuzzy Logic and DRASTIC Method for Sustainable Groundwater Management in Southeast Hungary",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "A hierarchical fuzzy inference system (FIS) integrated with the DRASTIC model is applied in this study to enhance the assessment of shallow groundwater vulnerability in southeast Hungary, a region characterized by extensive agriculture and industrial growth. Traditional groundwater vulnerability models often struggle with parameter imprecision and uncertainty, affecting their reliability. To address these limitations, fuzzy logic was incorporated to refine the classification of vulnerability zones. The hierarchical FIS incorporates the seven DRASTIC parameters: depth to the water table, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, vadose zone impact, and hydraulic conductivity, assigning flexible ratings through fuzzy membership functions. The model classifies the fuzzy groundwater vulnerability index (FGWVI) into low, moderate, and high categories, revealing that 63.9% of the study area is highly susceptible to contamination, particularly in regions with shallow water tables and sandy soils. Validation was conducted using nitrate (NO3−) concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements from 46 agricultural wells to assess the correlation between predicted vulnerability zones and actual groundwater quality indicators. The correlation analysis revealed a moderately strong positive relationship between FGWVI and both NO3− (R2 = 0.4785) and EC (R2 = 0.528), supporting the model’s ability to identify high-risk contamination zones. This study highlights the effectiveness of the fuzzy-enhanced DRASTIC model in evaluating aquifer vulnerability and provides crucial insights to assist policymakers in identifying pollution sources and developing strategies to mitigate groundwater contamination, thereby alleviating the stress on this critical resource.",

    "title": "A Fuzzy Logic Framework for Text-Based Incident Prioritization: Mathematical Modeling and Case Study Evaluation",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Incident prioritization is a critical task in enterprise environments, where textual descriptions of service disruptions often contain vague or ambiguous language. Traditional machine learning models, while effective in rigid classification, struggle to interpret the linguistic uncertainty inherent in natural language reports. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based framework for incident categorization and prioritization, integrating natural language processing (NLP) with a formal system of fuzzy inference. The framework transforms semantic embeddings from incident reports into fuzzy sets, allowing incident severity and urgency to be represented as degrees of membership in multiple categories. A mathematical model based on Mamdani-type inference and triangular membership functions is developed to capture and process imprecise inputs. The proposed system is evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising 10,000 incident descriptions from a mid-sized technology enterprise. A comparative evaluation is conducted against two baseline models: a fine-tuned BERT classifier and a traditional support vector machine (SVM). Results show that the fuzzy logic approach achieves a 7.4% improvement in F1-score over BERT (92.1% vs. 85.7%) and a 12.5% improvement over SVM (92.1% vs. 79.6%) for medium-severity incidents, where linguistic ambiguity is most prevalent. Qualitative analysis from domain experts confirmed that the fuzzy model provided more interpretable and context-aware classifications, improving operator trust and alignment with human judgment. These findings suggest that fuzzy modeling offers a mathematically sound and operationally effective solution for managing uncertainty in text-based incident management, contributing to the broader understanding of mathematical modeling in enterprise-scale social phenomena.",

This research develops a water quality monitoring system using the Mamdani fuzzy logic method based on three main parameters, namely temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The system was designed to handle the uncertainty and indecisiveness often encountered in water quality assessment, particularly in aquaculture environments. Temperature parameters are classified into cold, normal, and hot categories; pH into acidic, neutral, and alkaline categories; and DO into low, medium, and high categories. Simulation and implementation of the fuzzy inference system were conducted using MATLAB software. Through the process of fuzzification, rule-based inference, and defuzzification, the system successfully predicts the water quality status from bad, normal and good categories. The system is proven to be effective in evaluating water quality status and has the potential to support smarter and more adaptive management of koi fish farming environments.     ",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Power system stability is managed through various control loops, including the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), which regulates the terminal voltage of synchronous generators. This study integrated Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) and a Proportional–Integral–Derivative controller with Filtered derivative action (PIDF) to propose a hybrid Fuzzy PIDF controller enhanced by Fractional-Order Proportional-Derivative (FOPD) for AVR applications. For the first time, the newly introduced Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm was applied to the AVR system to tune the parameters of the proposed fuzzy controller. The SCSO algorithm has been recognized as a powerful optimization tool and has demonstrated success across various engineering applications. The well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was also utilized in this study to optimize the gains of the proposed controller. The Fuzzy PIDF plus FOPD is a novel configuration that is designed to be a robust control technique for AVR to achieve an excellent performance. In this research, the Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller was optimized using the PSO and SCSO algorithms by minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) objective function to enhance the overall performance of AVR systems. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the proposed approach by benchmarking the results against those of other controllers reported in the literature. Furthermore, the robustness of the controller was assessed under parametric uncertainties and varying load disturbances. Also, its robustness was examined against disturbances in the control signal. The results demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller tuned by the PSO and SCSO algorithms delivers exceptional performance as an AVR controller, outperforming other controllers. Additionally, the findings confirm the robustness of the Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller against parametric uncertainties, establishing its potential for a successful implementation in real-time applications.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Two important Quality of Experience (QoE) parameters in computer networks service-related performance metrics are throughput and end-to-end delay. A slow delay indicates high network efficiency thus high throughput. Similarly, the entire four parameters linked to the integrity of service (Delay, Jitter, Packet Loss, and Throughput) are deliberated to be primary factors affecting almost all computer networks. The study's objective is to identify the vital primary parameters with preeminent results to be kept into consideration when analyzing Network QoE by using a fuzzy logic methodology. The tools used in the study were Linux MTR (my trace-route) tool for data extraction, Ms. Excel for data cleaning and presentation, MATLAB(matrix laboratory) software for plotting of functions/data, and creation of interfaces. A Fuzzy logic methodology was implemented using an experimental research design. The analysis of results using independent sample T-Test technique compared four primary parameters affecting any network to the two important QoE parameters. The results specified a significant consequence using the entire four Integrity of service parameters model compared to using a combination of two parameters model for consideration of network QoE whereby the p-value obtained was 0.017 which is less than 0.05. The target population for this model is the service providers enabling them to have the finest approachable measures to deal with network service providers to achieve QoS (Quality of service) in line with Service Level Agreement (SLAs) thus achieving finest network QoE.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) also known as heart disease are now the leading cause of death in the world. This paper presents research for the design and creation of a fuzzy logic-based expert system for the prognosis and diagnosis of heart disease that is precise, economical, and effective. This system entails a fuzzification module, knowledge base, inference engine, and defuzzification module where seven attributes such as chest pain type, HbA1c (Haemoglobin A1c), HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), heart rate, age, and blood pressure are considered as input to the system. With the aid of the available literature and extensive consultation with medical experts in this field, an enriched knowledge database has been created with a sufficient number of IF-THEN rules for the diagnosis of heart disease. The inference engine then activates the appropriate IF-THEN rule from the knowledge base and determines the output value using the appropriate defuzzification technique after the fuzzification module fuzzifies each input depending on the appropriate membership function. Moreover, the fusion of web-based technology makes it suitable and cost-effective for the prognosis of heart disease for a patient and then he can take his decision for addressing the problem based on the status of his heart. On the other hand, it can also assist a medical practitioner to reach a more accurate conclusion regarding the treatment of heart disease for a patient. The Mamdani inference method has been used to evaluate the results. The system is tested with the Cleveland dataset and cross-checked with the in-field dataset. Compared with the other existing expert systems, the proposed method performs 98.08% accurately and can make accurate decisions for diagnosing heart diseases.",

That technique requires one to construct the vector space over powersets, and therefore is computationally costly. In this paper, we overcome this problem by considering fuzzy versions of quantifiers along the lines of Zadeh, within the category of many valued relations. We show that this category is a concrete instantiation of the compositional distributional model. We show that the semantics obtained in this model is equivalent to the semantics of the fuzzy quantifiers of Zadeh.

We formalise in this model the generalised quantifier theory of natural language, due to Barwise and Cooper. The underlying setting is a compact closed category with bialgebras. We start from a generative grammar formalisation and develop an abstract categorical compositional semantics for it, and then instantiate the abstract setting to sets and relations and to finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps. We prove the equivalence of the relational instantiation to the truth theoretic semantics of generalised quantifiers.

This paper deals with the topic of coordination between identical syntactic types, which accounts for the majority of coordination cases in language. By exploiting the compact closed structure of the underlying category and Frobenius operators canonically induced over the fixed basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces, we provide a morphism as representation of a coordinator tensor, and we show how it lifts from atomic types to compound types. Linguistic intuitions are provided, and the importance of the Frobenius operators as an addition to the compact closed setting with regard to language is discussed.",

The theoretical framework allows for reasoning about compositional aspects of language and offers structural ways of studying the underlying relationships. While the model so far has been applied on the level of syntactic structures, a sentence can bring extra information conveyed in utterances via intonational means. In the current paper we extend the framework in order to accommodate this additional information, using Frobenius algebraic structures canonically induced over the basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Taking advantage of the abstract categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation. \nThe new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts. This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our graded order. \nOur main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment.

    "abstract": "Distributional semantic models provide vector representations for words by gathering co-occurrence frequencies from corpora of text. Compositional distributional models extend these from words to phrases and sentences. In categorical compositional distributional semantics, phrase and sentence representations are functions of their grammatical structure and representations of the words therein. In this setting, grammatical structures are formalised by morphisms of a compact closed category and meanings of words are formalised by objects of the same category. These can be instantiated in the form of vectors or density matrices. This paper concerns the applications of this model to phrase and sentence level entailment. We argue that entropy-based distances of vectors and density matrices provide a good candidate to measure word-level entailment, show the advantage of density matrices over vectors for word level entailments, and prove that these distances extend compositionally from words to phrases and sentences. We exemplify our theoretical constructions on real data and a toy entailment dataset and provide preliminary experimental evidence.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "The provision of compositionality in distributional models of meaning, where a word is represented as a vector of co-occurrence counts with every other word in the vocabulary, offers a solution to the fact that no text corpus, regardless of its size, is capable of providing reliable co-occurrence statistics for anything but very short text constituents. The purpose of a compositional distributional model is to provide a function that composes the vectors for the words within a sentence, in order to create a vectorial representation that re ects its meaning. Using the abstract mathematical framework of category theory, Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark showed that this function can directly depend on the grammatical structure of the sentence, providing an elegant mathematical counterpart of the formal semantics view. The framework is general and compositional but stays abstract to a large extent. This thesis contributes to ongoing research related to the above categorical model in three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract framework based on Frobenius algebras (joint work with Sadrzadeh). The theory improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results. The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models thatfind intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work with Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in particular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum mechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different meanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and linguistics.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is about the problem of compositionality in distributional semantics. Distributional semantics presupposes that the meanings of words are a function of their occurrences in textual contexts. It models words as distributions over these contexts and represents them as vectors in high dimensional spaces. The problem of compositionality for such models concerns itself with how to produce representations for larger units of text by composing the representations of smaller units of text. \nThis thesis focuses on a particular approach to this compositionality problem, namely using the categorical framework developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark, which combines syntactic analysis formalisms with distributional semantic representations of meaning to produce syntactically motivated composition operations. This thesis shows how this approach can be theoretically extended and practically implemented to produce concrete compositional distributional models of natural language semantics. It furthermore demonstrates that such models can perform on par with, or better than, other competing approaches in the field of natural language processing. \nThere are three principal contributions to computational linguistics in this thesis. The first is to extend the DisCoCat framework on the syntactic front and semantic front, incorporating a number of syntactic analysis formalisms and providing learning procedures allowing for the generation of concrete compositional distributional models. The second contribution is to evaluate the models developed from the procedures presented here, showing that they outperform other compositional distributional models present in the literature. The third contribution is to show how using category theory to solve linguistic problems forms a sound basis for research, illustrated by examples of work on this topic, that also suggest directions for future research.",

To achieve this we introduce a notion of basic anaphoric discourses as a mid-level representation between natural language discourse formalised in terms of basic discourse representation structures (DRS); and knowledge base queries over the Semantic Web as described by basic graph patterns in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This provides a high-level specification for compositional algorithms for question answering and anaphora resolution, and allows us to give a picture of natural language understanding as a process involving both statistical and logical resources.",

Автор зробив критичний огляд термінів «екосистема мови», «біолінгвістична традиція»; вказано на потенційні негативні ризики адаптації біоморфних метафор у мовну політику, оскільки об’єктивізація, перерахування та біологізація мов робить їх природними об’єктами, а не культурними артефактами. Акцентовано, що екологічний термін є елементом екологічної терміносистеми, називає спеціальне поняття і вимагає чіткої дефініції. Збереження первинного науково-природничого змісту понять «екологія», «екосистема» є необхідним, оскільки розв’язання екологічних проблем потребує визначення й інтенсифікації тих напрямів досліджень, де можна віднайти шляхи природовідповідного існування людства. Вказано на перспективність практичного застосування екологічного дискурсу у викладацькій практиці, лексикографічній роботі, формуванні за «принципом доповнювальності» у носіїв мови soft skills у вигляді культури мови, національної єдності, екологічних цінностей.",

    "abstract": "The role of types in categorical models of meaning is investigated. A general scheme for how typed models of meaning may be used to compare sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure is described, and a toy example is used as an illustration. Taking as a starting point the question of whether the evaluation of such a type system 'loses information', we consider the parametrized typing associated with connectives from this viewpoint. \nThe answer to this question implies that, within full categorical models of meaning, the objects associated with types must exhibit a simple but subtle categorical property known as self-similarity. We investigate the category theory behind this, with explicit reference to typed systems, and their monoidal closed structure. We then demonstrate close connections between such self-similar structures and dagger Frobenius algebras. In particular, we demonstrate that the categorical structures implied by the polymorphically typed connectives give rise to a (lax unitless) form of the special forms of Frobenius algebras known as classical structures, used heavily in abstract categorical approaches to quantum mechanics.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Inquiry performs one of the backbones in current E-commerce websites. Detecting spams in inquiries is essential for these platforms but is surprisingly underexplored by current research. In this paper, we propose a system coined ISTBEL to detect spam inquiries. Motivated by the observations on both behavioral and linguistic differences between spammers and benign users, ISTBEL jointly utilizes the temporal-categorical behavioral sequence and text sequence to accomplish its purpose. At its heart, a variant of LSTM equipped interactive attentions is devised to strengthen the coherence between the categorical and temporal behaviors. A character-level CNN is adopted to capture the capricious linguistic patterns. These two modules are integrated and collaboratively contribute to the final predictions. Our system is trained through an end-to-end manner and can directly utilize raw data as input without tedious feature engineering. We have applied the system to inquiry spam detection on Alibaba.com, and results show ISTBEL is promising in detection spammers and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Meanwhile, ISTBEL can be easily applied to other applications which contain both behavioral and linguistic information.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This research offers a detailed functional and categorical analysis of particles in spoken Sinhala, emphasising their essential role in the language's syntax and semantics. Sinhala particles are non-inflecting elements that attach to nominal or verbal constituents, serving various communicative functions. Through authentic spoken data, the study identifies eight distinct categories of particles: case, predicative, highlighting, conjunctive, discourse, interrogative, quotative, and negative particles. The analysis demonstrates how these particles contribute significantly to the clarity, coherence, and expressiveness of spoken Sinhala. Despite their small size and lack of inflexion, particles play a crucial role in organising discourse, marking pragmatic nuances, and shaping meaning. This study fills a gap in Sinhala linguistics by providing comprehensive examples and categorisation based on real language use. The findings have important implications for linguistic theory, language teaching, and the development of natural language processing tools for Sinhala. Future research is recommended to explore particle usage across dialects, social contexts, and historical development.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "We present a new theoretical framework that unifies category-theoretic fixed-point constructions, transfinite recursion, and game-based semantics to model how interpretations of language can stabilize through unlimited self-reference. By iterating a meaning-refinement operator across all ordinal stages, we isolate a unique\"transordinal\"fixed point and show, via a hierarchy of reflective games, that this same object is the sole equilibrium of an infinite dialogue between a text and its interpreter. The result delivers a mathematically rigorous account of semantic convergence without resorting to statistical training or empirical benchmarks, yet remains simple to explain: start with a rough meaning, let speaker and listener correct each other forever, and the process provably settles on a single, self-consistent interpretation. Because the construction is entirely symbolic, it offers both precise guarantees for formal linguistics and a blueprint for designing language-aware systems that can reason about their own outputs. The paper details the requisite transordinal machinery, proves existence and uniqueness theorems, and connects them to long-standing questions about reflection, truth, and equilibrium in formal systems and semantics.",

Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of {\\Delta} = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields.

Our models can be seen as a variant of Montague semantics based on a lambda calculus where the primitives act on string diagrams rather than logical formulae. As a special case, we show how to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for first-order logic. This allows us to give a purely diagrammatic treatment of higher-order and non-linear processes in natural language semantics: adverbs, prepositions, negation and quantifiers. The definition presented in this article comes with a proof-of-concept implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for string diagrams.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Lexical disambiguation is one of the oldest problems in natural language processing. There are three main types of lexical ambiguity: part-of-speech ambiguity, homonymy, and polysemy, typically divided into two tasks in practice. While this division suffices for engineering purposes, it does not align well with human intuition. In this article, I use lexical ambiguity as a representative case to demonstrate how insights from theoretical linguistics can be helpful for developing more human-like meaning and knowledge representations in natural language understanding. I revisit the three types of lexical ambiguity and propose a structured reclassification of them into two levels using the theoretical linguistic tool of root syntax. Recognizing the uneven expressive power of root syntax across these levels, I further translate the theoretical linguistic insights into the language of category theory, mainly using the tool of topos. The resulting unified categorical representation of lexical ambiguity preserves rootsyntactic insights, has strong expressive power at both linguistic levels, and can potentially serve as a bridge between theoretical linguistics and natural language understanding. ",

Thus, we research the application of DisCoCat models in both quantum and classical natural language processing. Specifically, in classical and quantum natural language processing, we respectively converted sentences into tensor networks and quantum circuits based on the DisCoCat model to get representation containing both semantic and syntactic information of language in classical and quantum computer.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This study presents data format of episodic memory for artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of\"actions\"represented by verbs in natural languages and\"participants\"who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The study is devoted to the consideration of the terms, which are the most frequently used and significant for the formation of meaning in linguistics. The relevance of the study is, on the one hand, determined by the variety of approaches to their definition and interpretation, and, on the other hand, by the necessity to specify them to facilitate academic communication and linguistic analysis. The purpose of this work is to consider a number of such concepts and substantiate our approach to them and their interpretation. The study uses both general theoretical and linguistic research methods. Particular attention is paid to phenomenological analysis while considering the terms themselves, as well as semantic, categorical-constitutive, positional and pragmatic analysis while studying empirical material. There are considered the concepts of text, discourse, dicteme as a text unit, language personality of an author, or a narrator and a reader/listener. The article analyzes differences between the text and discourse concepts. The work substantiates heuristic potential of a dicteme as a minimum text unit. The dicteme is studied both - from elementary and holistic approaches, as a fractal that forms the space of the whole text according to synergistic laws. The study emphasizes the ideological role of a linguistic personality both at the stages of creation and consumption of a text. There is carried out a linguistic analysis of an English literary text in order to identify denotative and conceptual information in its ideological and aesthetic manifestation in it. The study highlights the role of strong positions of text in the transfer of conceptual information and considers the function of influence in an artistic and media works, which, in the first case, is mainly emotive in nature, and, in the second, manipulative. It underlines the interdependence of the conceptual priorities of the creator and consumer of a media text.",

    "abstract": "The article presents the theoretical foundations of the paradigmatic interdependence of contact and areal linguistics. The experience of scientific understanding of the spatial approach to the study of various aspects of language contact allows us to identify a tendency towards universalization of the conceptual apparatus of contact linguistics, as well as the correlation of the latter with the areal interpretation of the dialect landscape. It is emphasized that in the hierarchy of disciplines involved in the analysis of the processes and results of linguistic interaction, contact linguistics occupies a higher position. In this regard, the feasibility of integrating individual terms of this subject area into the categorical plane of areal linguistics is substantiated: the multifunctionality of the basic unit of contact linguistics – contacteme – makes it possible, firstly, to more objectively and accurately qualify complex areal phenomena (for example, when the stimulus for the emergence of innovation emanating from the source language is not equivalent to the result in the destination language), secondly, do not narrow the problem of language contacts to the issue of borrowings and bilingualism. Special attention is paid to the peculiarities of the terminological system of the described scientific fields. A number of issues are considered regarding the definition of the linguistic essence of the key concepts “contact zone”, “borrowing”, “infiltration”, etc. It is established that the term “contact zone” has conceptual significance not only for arealological studies, in a broader context it is included in the system concepts of contactology.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the characteristic of a new integrative area of linguistics – linguometaphorology, in which a theoretical and methodological base as well as a categorical and terminological apparatus are gradually being formed, empirical material is accumulating. However, many theoretical provisions require scientific rethinking, generalization, and systematization, while terminology needs clarification and unification. Based on the analysis of the main linguometaphorological works, the leading directions and current problems of linguometaphorology, basic methods of studying metaphorics are described, and dynamics of this branch of linguistics development is predicted. \nThe analysis of linguometaphorological researchs of the late 20th–21st centuries shows that the study of metaphors is most productively carried out in the semantic and cognitive directions. The author of this paper develops a semantic-cognitive approach to the study of metaphors, the relevance of which is due to the objective necessity of its theoretical understanding as a single mental-verbal construct. \nThe current problems of linguometaphorology are as follows: defining the essence of metaphor; establishing the principles of modelling metaphorization and the parameters of metaphorical models; clarifying the specifics of the metaphorical picture of the world; identifying the features of metaphorical conceptualization; developing methods and techniques for the complex analysis of metaphorics; developing the principles of the lexicographic description of metaphors and compiling metaphorical dictionaries. The methodology of linguometaphorology, which is developing in various directions, is based on such linguistic methods as componential analysis, contextual analysis, linguistic (semantic, cognitive, semantic-cognitive) modelling. \nIt is promising to continue linguometaphorological research in semantic, cognitive, semantic-cognitive and lexicographic aspects. Further development of linguometaphorology will allow to get a deeper understanding of the nature and mechanisms of figurative-metaphorical thinking",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Dynamical systems---by which we mean machines that take time-varying input, change their state, and produce output---can be wired together to form more complex systems. Previous work has shown how to allow collections of machines to reconfigure their wiring diagram dynamically, based on their collective state. This notion was called \"mode dependence\", and while the framework was compositional (forming an operad of re-wiring diagrams and algebra of mode-dependent dynamical systems on it), the formulation itself was more \"creative\" than it was natural. \nIn this paper we show that the theory of mode-dependent dynamical systems can be more naturally recast within the category Poly of polynomial functors. This category is almost superlatively abundant in its structure: for example, it has \\emph{four} interacting monoidal structures $(+,\\times,\\otimes,\\circ)$, two of which ($\\times,\\otimes$) are monoidal closed, and the comonoids for $\\circ$ are precisely categories in the usual sense. We discuss how the various structures in Poly show up in the theory of dynamical systems. We also show that the usual coalgebraic formalism for dynamical systems takes place within Poly. Indeed one can see coalgebras as special dynamical systems---ones that do not record their history---formally analogous to contractible groupoids as special categories.",

These systems should be thought of as ‘machines’ with inputs and outputs, carrying some sort of signal that occurs through some notion of time. Special cases include continuous and discrete dynamical systems (e.g. Moore machines). Additionally, morphisms between the different types of systems allow their translation in a common framework. A central goal is to understand the systems that result from arbitrary interconnection of component subsystems, possibly of different types, as well as establish conditions that ensure totality and determinism compositionally. The fundamental categorical tools used here include lax monoidal functors, which provide a language of compositionality, as well as sheaf theory, which flexibly captures the crucial notion of time.",

We define several pseudo-functorial constructions of modules of systems in the form of doctrines of systems theories.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\\varepsilon \\dashv R_\\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Risk-reduction behaviors are the first line of defense in viral epidemics. Choosing to not engage in risk-reduction behaviors produced millions of preventable deaths from COVID-19. Understanding why this happens and how to predict it is important for theory development and public policy. We took four approaches to this problem: experimentally varying theory-driven predictors (social rewards, transmission risk, and mandatory/voluntary regulations) in choice scenarios, further probing choices in specific scenarios predicted to elicit risk-taking, conducting hierarchical regressions with demographic and theory-driven predictors for both scenario types, and conducting corresponding regressions for self-reported protective behaviors. The sample consisted of 247 young adults to test highly publicized predictions about how the virus would spread and who would take risks. Results showed that risky choices for scenarios correlated with self-reported behavior and varied with transmission risk and whether regulations were mandatory. Experimentally varying social reward did not elicit greater risk taking as expected by dual-systems theory but risk taking in specific social scenarios was predicted by individual differences in sensation seeking as predicted by dual-systems theory. Sensation seeking predicted social distancing and impulsivity predicted mask wearing. Fuzzy-trace theory's predictors of categorical thinking about risk and endorsement of simple gist principles of social responsibility (to not hurt other people) consistently predicted choices and behaviors, accounting for significant variance beyond dual-systems predictors. Both controlled experiments and real-world self-reported behaviors converged on similar conclusions, identifying a major gap in influential theories (the omission of gist-based thinking) and challenging pessimistic predictions about motivations and mandates in public health.",

    "abstract": "Organizing physics has been a long-standing preoccupation of applied category theory, going back at least to Lawvere. We contribute to this research thread by noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on a consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure -- from the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a compositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a different perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems or open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create any new constraints that must be solved for algebraically. The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric monoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential equations, and a functor between them, functioning as a\"functorial semantics\"for reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for open games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter. We then illustrate our theory by constructing an n-fold pendulum as a composite of n-many pendula.",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) is used to measure cognitive flexibility. In WCST, the participants are required to estimate underlying rules (called \"category\" in WCST) from given sensory signals. Computational modeling of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST is important for elucidating flexible cognitive processing. In this study, we propose a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for explaining the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST, based on the free energy principle (FEP). FEP explains perception and goal-directed action as the minimization of prediction errors between predicted and real sensory signals (called free-energy minimization) and is expected to be an integrated theory of the brain. The primary characteristic of our model is that it considers free energy at future time steps, enabling it to correctly answer WCST as a goal-directed behavior based on the FEP. The simulation experiment showed that the proposed model successfully estimated the underlying categories to be estimated in WCST and correctly answer WCST. This indicates that the proposed model may provide mechanistic insights into flexible cognitive processing from the perspective of FEP.",

Although these two cybernetic theories were developed independently, they overlap in their theoretical foundations and implications and are complementary in their approaches to understanding persons. FEP-AI contributes a potentially valuable formal modeling framework for CB5T, while CB5T provides detail about the science and structure of personality. In this chapter we explore how CB5T and FEP-AI may begin to be integrated into a unified approach to modeling persons.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) are two foundational, principle-based frameworks originally developed to explain brain function. However, since their initial proposals, both frameworks have been generalized to account for the behavior of living systems more broadly. Despite their conceptual overlap and practical successes, a mathematical comparison of the two frameworks has yet to be undertaken. In this article, we briefly introduce and compare the philosophical foundations underlying PCT and FEP. We then introduce and compare their experimental and mathematical foundations concretely in the context of bacterial chemotaxis. With these foundations in place, we can use tools from category theory to argue that PCT can be formally understood as a subset of the FEP framework; however, it is worth noting that the mathematical machinery unique to FEP is not required to successfully model bacterial chemotaxis. Finally, we conclude with a proposal for a mathematical synthesis where each framework plays an orthogonal yet complementary role.",

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "Attempts to establish an absolute single-ion hydration free energy scale have followed multiple strategies. Two central themes consist of (1) employing bulk pair thermodynamic data and an underlying interfacial-potential-free model to partition the hydration free energy into individual contributions [Marcus, Latimer, and tetraphenyl-arsonium/tetraphenyl-borate (TATB) methods] or (2) utilizing bulk thermodynamic and cluster data to estimate the free energy to insert a proton into water, including in principle an interfacial potential contribution [the cluster pair approximation (CPA)]. While the results for the hydration free energy of the proton agree remarkably well between the three approaches in the first category, the value differs from the CPA result by roughly +10 kcal/mol, implying a value for the effective electrochemical surface potential of water of -0.4 V. This paper provides a computational re-analysis of the TATB method for single-ion free energies using quasichemical theory. A previous study indicated a significant discrepancy between the free energies of hydration for the TA cation and the TB anion. We show that the main contribution to this large computed difference is an electrostatic artifact arising from modeling interactions in periodic boundaries. No attempt is made here to develop more accurate models for the local ion/solvent interactions that may lead to further small free energy differences between the TA and TB ions, but the results clarify the primary importance of interfacial potential effects for analysis of the various free energy scales. Results are also presented, related to the TATB assumption in the organic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dichloroethane.",

It is proposed that the global gauge group of such a theory can be identified as the group of automorphisms of the defining functor. Consequently, multiplets of fields may be identified at the functorial level. It is shown that locally covariant theories that obey standard assumptions in Minkowski space, including energy compactness, have no proper endomorphisms (i.e., all endomorphisms are automorphisms) and have a compact automorphism group. Further, it is shown how the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a locally covariant theory may, in principle, be classified in any single spacetime. As an example, the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a system of finitely many free scalar fields are completely classified.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "This paper delves into the application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the concept of the Markov blanket in understanding the neurocognitive implications of concussion. The FEP, a unifying theory in neuroscience, posits that the brain functions to minimize free energy, equating to a reduction in surprise or uncertainty regarding sensory inputs. The Markov blanket, defining the boundary between a system and its environment, is integral to this framework, particularly in understanding how the brain processes and responds to sensory information. We explore how a concussion might disrupt the brain's predictive processing and its ability to minimize free energy, leading to increased prediction errors and cognitive deficits. This disruption is hypothesized to manifest as an inability to accurately predict sensory inputs, resulting in impaired cognitive functions post-concussion. The paper also discusses the potential of neuroplasticity in concussion recovery, framed within the FEP as the brain's effort to re-establish minimized free energy under new constraints. We propose a methodological approach combining neuroimaging and computational modeling to empirically test these hypotheses. This theoretical exploration offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying concussion-induced cognitive impairments and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation strategies.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical approaches. The first aims to make a formal framework for describing self-organizing and life-like systems in general, and the second attempts a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior, the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potential for scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards such a synthesis by expanding on the results of an earlier published evolutionary simulation study, which show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We relate a basic information theoretic measure from the FEP, surprisal, to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ observations is inversely related to the general increase in fitness and integration over evolutionary time. Moreover, surprisal fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures used in IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that it should therefore be possible to relate them to the theoretical concepts used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

However, it faces challenges such as a lack of out-of-distribution generalisation, catastrophic forgetting and poor interpretability. In contrast, biological neural networks, such as those in the human brain, do not suffer from these issues, inspiring AI researchers to explore neuromimetic deep learning, which aims to replicate brain mechanisms within AI models. A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy Principle (FEP) based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle emphasizes that the brain and behavior coordinate with the environment, promoting self-organization. However, it has a theoretical flaw, a possibility of being misunderstood, and a limitation (only likelihood functions are used as constraints). This paper first introduces the semantic information G theory and the R(G) function (where R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). The G theory is based on the P-T probability framework and, therefore, allows for the use of truth, membership, similarity, and distortion functions (related to semantics) as constraints. Based on the study of the R(G) function and logical Bayesian Inference, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R − G = F − H(X|Y) (where F denotes VFE, and H(X|Y) is Shannon conditional entropy) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables; SVB is a reliable and straightforward approach for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, free energy, and VFE in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon information, semantic information, and VFE are analogous to the increment of free energy, the increment of exergy, and physical conditional entropy. The MIE principle builds upon the fundamental ideas of the FEP, making them easier to understand and apply. It needs to combine deep learning methods for wider applications.",

The free-energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised cognitive dynamics of the brain’s higher-order functions. In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.",

    "abstract": "There are realist and antirealist interpretations of the free energy principle (FEP). This paper aims to chart out a structural realist interpretation of FEP. To do so, it draws on Worrall’s (Dialectica 43(1–2): 99–124, 1989) proposal. The general insight of Worrall’s paper is that there is progress at the level of the structure of theories rather than their content. To enact Worrall’s strategy in the context of FEP, this paper will focus on characterising the formal continuity between fundamental equations of thermodynamics—such as Boltzmann’s equation and Gibbs’s equation—on the one hand, and Friston’s characterisation of FEP on the other. Lack of a universal consensus on the physical character of entities that feature in thermodynamics, information theory and FEP notwithstanding, I argue that there is structural continuity and unity at the level of mathematical equations that regiment entropy, information and free energy. The existence of such structural continuity and unity provides grounds for structural realism about FEP.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is currently one of the most promising frameworks with which to address a unified explanation of life-related phenomena. With powerful formalism that embeds a small set of assumptions, it purports to deal with complex adaptive dynamics ranging from barely unicellular organisms to complex cultural manifestations. The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance—in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations—is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account—an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the ‘aboutness’ or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.",

    "title": "An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation",
    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.",

    "abstract": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.",

    "title": "Consciousness Fluctuates with Surprise: An empirical pre-study for the synthesis of the Free Energy Principle and Integrated Information Theory",
    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical frameworks, the first aiming to make a general formal description of self-organization and life-like processes, and the second attempting a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potentially great scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards this synthesis by first partially replicating the results of the evolutionary simulation study by Albantakis et al. (2014) that show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We then relate FEP-related information theoretic measures to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ system states follows the general increase in fitness over evolutionary time, and that it fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures of IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that they therefore should be related to concepts directly used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

    "title": "Models of the Translation Process and the Free Energy Principle",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Translation process research (TPR) has generated a large number of models that aim at explaining human translation processes. In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.",

    "title": "A Neural Network Implementation for Free Energy Principle",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT I investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms and socio-emotional factors behind conspiracy theory (CT) beliefs through the lens of the Free-Energy Principle (FEP). The FEP framework is employed to explain the emergence of CTs in the face of cumulative uncertainties and the influence of emotions on belief formation. The FEP account I propose concludes that considering emotional factors, distrust of established authorities, and the social environment, believing in CTs is a bounded rational choice for some individuals in certain contexts. This explains why CT believers are resistant to changing their views. Applying FEP to the complex human behavior of CT belief and propagation, this paper not only provides insights into the phenomenon but also enhances the theoretical credence of FEP itself.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.",

    "title": "Beauty and Uncertainty as Transformative Factors: A Free Energy Principle Account of Aesthetic Diagnosis and Intervention in Gestalt Psychotherapy",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Drawing from field theory, Gestalt therapy conceives psychological suffering and psychotherapy as two intentional field phenomena, where unprocessed and chaotic experiences seek the opportunity to emerge and be assimilated through the contact between the patient and the therapist (i.e., the intentionality of contacting). This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.",
