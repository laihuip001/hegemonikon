    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study developed a Python-based framework to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations on cohesionless soil, employing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 116 footing experiments, Eleven ML models (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) etc.) and five DL models (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), etc.) trained and compared against traditional methods. Input parameters included foundation dimensions and soil properties. Results demonstrated that ML and DL models significantly outperformed traditional equations, achieving higher accuracy. Ensemble methods like GPR, XGBoost, GBM, RF, and CatBoost exhibited superior performance, with a Coefficient of Determination (R2) values above 0.988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 5.07%. Conversely, traditional methods showed lower accuracy, with R2 values ranging from 0.684 to 0.82 and MAPE exceeding 19.63%. Taylor diagram analysis confirmed the improved performance of ML and DL. Additionally, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis highlighted foundation depth and soil friction angle as the most influential parameters, consistent with geotechnical principles.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose GAIA, a generative AI architecture based on category theory. GAIA is based on a hierarchical model where modules are organized as a simplicial complex. Each simplicial complex updates its internal parameters biased on information it receives from its superior simplices and in turn relays updates to its subordinate sub-simplices. Parameter updates are formulated in terms of lifting diagrams over simplicial sets, where inner and outer horn extensions correspond to different types of learning problems. Backpropagation is modeled as an endofunctor over the category of parameters, leading to a coalgebraic formulation of deep learning.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The integration of knowledge extracted from diverse models, whether described by domain experts or generated by machine learning algorithms, has historically been challenged by the absence of a suitable framework for specifying and integrating structures, learning processes, data transformations, and data models or rules. In this work, we extend algebraic specification methods to address these challenges within such a framework. In our work, we tackle the challenging task of developing a comprehensive framework for defining and analyzing deep learning architectures. We believe that previous efforts have fallen short by failing to establish a clear connection between the constraints a model must adhere to and its actual implementation. Our methodology employs graphical structures that resemble Ehresmann's sketches, interpreted within a universe of fuzzy sets. This approach offers a unified theory that elegantly encompasses both deterministic and non-deterministic neural network designs. Furthermore, we highlight how this theory naturally incorporates fundamental concepts from computer science and automata theory. Our extended algebraic specification framework, grounded in graphical structures akin to Ehresmann's sketches, offers a promising solution for integrating knowledge across disparate models and domains. By bridging the gap between domain-specific expertise and machine-generated insights, we pave the way for more comprehensive, collaborative, and effective approaches to knowledge integration and modeling.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "We provide a construction for categorical representation learning and introduce the foundations of ‘categorifier’. The central theme in representation learning is the idea of everything to vector. Every object in a dataset S can be represented as a vector in Rn by an encoding map E:Obj(S)→Rn . More importantly, every morphism can be represented as a matrix E:Hom(S)→Rnn . The encoding map E is generally modeled by a deep neural network. The goal of representation learning is to design appropriate tasks on the dataset to train the encoding map (assuming that an encoding is optimal if it universally optimizes the performance on various tasks). However, the latter is still a set-theoretic approach. The goal of the current article is to promote the representation learning to a new level via a category-theoretic approach. As a proof of concept, we provide an example of a text translator equipped with our technology, showing that our categorical learning model outperforms the current deep learning models by 17 times.

    "title": "A Machine Learning Model for Pile Settlement Prediction Using Majority Voting-Based Feature Selection",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Pile foundations are deep foundations commonly employed in bridge construction, high-rise buildings, trains, and situations requiring high bearing capacity and minimal settlement. Accurate prediction of pile settlement is essential for ensuring the safety and stability of deep foundations, yet traditional methods like in-situ load tests are often costly and impractical. The cone penetration test (CPT) is one of the most frequent in-situ tests for pile analysis because, like a model pile, the measured cone resistance and sleeve fiction can be used to estimate pile unit toe and shaft resistances, respectively. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework for pile settlement prediction with a genetic algorithm (GA) majority voting (MV) feature selection (FS) strategy to enhance model performance is presented. Three tree-based algorithms, each with a unique approach for tree development and feature handling—categorical boosting (CB), light gradient boosting (LGB), and random forest (RF) are selected for this purpose. The dataset was compiled from fifty-six pile case histories in different countries have been compiled including static loading tests which include maintained load tests and constant rate of penetration tests, shaft, and toe resistances which comprise CPT and CPTu (undrained CPT) sounding, the pile geometric and mechanical properties, the loads applied from the load tests as the model inputs, and recorded settlement values for the piles from the tests as the model output to be predicted. The CB model, coupled with the GA-MV approach, achieved the best predictive accuracy, yielding an <I>R²</I> of 0.926 and RMSE of 5.92 mm upon testing, while feature importance analysis identifies applied load (P) and pile length (L) as key predictors of settlement. Also, an overall decrease of the RMSE by 11.19% was observed between the CB-GAMV model (5.92 mm) and the CB-All features model (6.68 mm), and 9.41% between the CB-GAMV model and the CB-GA model (6.54 mm) on the validation set.\n",

    "abstract": "Discussed are problems of modern mathematical education: the development of the conceptual apparatus of mathematics, as well as the development of thinking in modal categories when proving mathematical propositions and solving probabilistic problems. The work is based on the results of the explication of the ontological foundations of mathematics obtained earlier. It is shown that the basis of a holistic, deep perception of the mathematical laws of being is categorical intuition with subsequent rationalization of mathematical objects. It is emphasized that such objects are not always possible to describe by means of extensional logic: an important place in the categorical structuring of mathematical knowledge is occupied by ontic modalities of the necessary and possible. The author expresses concern about the tendency of algorithmization of mathematical thinking in the learning process as opposed to historically established methods of creative search for proofs, alternatives, and opportunities. Special attention is paid to the topic of the teacher’s implementation of the ideological and educational function of mathematical science. Taking into account the enormous development of computing and information technologies, it is necessary to remember about the anthropological and humanitarian components of modern science and education. In substantiation of the relevance and discussion of the raised issues, the points of view of specialists from various fields are given: mathematicians, historians, teachers. This article is addressed to a wide range of readers: scientists, teachers, graduate students, freelance researchers.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Research into machine learning and deep learning methods for image categorization has been sparked by the explosion of visual content available on digital platforms, with particular interest in domains such as food image recognition. With so many food-related images available on the internet and social media platforms, automated food image categorization is a major difficulty. Deep Convolutional Neural Network architectures offer a promising approach by leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning to extract meaningful image representations. EfficientNetB0 is an example of a pre-trained deep learning architecture that has demonstrated impressive ability in extracting high-level features from images. This study explores the effectiveness of using deep features extracted from the average pooling layer of a fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model for the classification of complex food images using the Food-101 dataset. Subsequently, the features extracted are passed as input to a Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) classifier. To assess performance, we compare the classification accuracies of CatBoost, Support Vector Machines with various kernels, and a Random Forest classifier, all utilizing the same set of extracted features, against the accuracy of the end-to-end fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model. Our experiments reveal that the proposed EfficientNetB0-CatBoost framework achieves the highest classification accuracy for classifying complex food images, highlighting the potential of CatBoost for efficient classification of deep features.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) - a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data, relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables(ii) the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges including large scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models that can transform the processing of relational data.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.",

Unlike prior surveys that focus primarily on either architecture design or learning strategies, we adopt a holistic perspective that emphasizes the universality and robustness of representation learning methods across diverse downstream tasks. We examine recent advances in data augmentation and generation, specialized neural network architectures tailored to tabular data, and innovative learning objectives that enhance representation quality. Additionally, we highlight the growing influence of self-supervised learning and the adaptation of transformer-based foundation models for tabular data. Our review is based on a systematic literature search using rigorous inclusion criteria, encompassing 127 papers published since 2020 in top-tier conferences and journals. Through detailed analysis and comparison, we identify emerging trends, critical gaps, and promising directions for future research, aiming to guide the development of more generalizable and effective tabular data representation methods.",

Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory -- precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps -- as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.",

At present, the field lacks strong theoretical underpinnings, and many important achievements stem from ad hoc design choices which are hard to justify in principle and whose effectiveness often goes unexplained. Research debt is increasing and many papers are found not to be reproducible. This thesis is a survey that covers some recent work attempting to study machine learning categorically. Category theory is a branch of abstract mathematics that has found successful applications in many fields, both inside and outside mathematics. Acting as a lingua franca of mathematics and science, category theory might be able to give a unifying structure to the field of machine learning. This could solve some of the aforementioned problems. In this work, we mainly focus on the application of category theory to deep learning. Namely, we discuss the use of categorical optics to model gradient-based learning, the use of categorical algebras and integral transforms to link classical computer science to neural networks, the use of functors to link different layers of abstraction and preserve structure, and, finally, the use of string diagrams to provide detailed representations of neural network architectures.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Large-scale mapping of soil resources can be crucial and indispensable for several of the managerial applications and policy implications. With machine learning models being the most utilized modeling technique for digital soil mapping (DSM), the implementation of model-based deep learning methods for spatial soil predictions is still under scrutiny. In this study, soil continuous (pH and OC) and categorical variables (order and suborder) were predicted using deep learning–multi layer perceptron (DL-MLP) and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) for the entire state of Tamil Nadu, India. For training the deep learning models, 27,098 profile observations (0–30 cm) were extracted from the generated soil database, considering soil series as the distinctive stratum. A total of 43 SCORPAN-based environmental covariates were considered, of which 37 covariates were retained after the recursive feature elimination (RFE) process. The validation and test results obtained for each of the soil attributes for both the algorithms were most comparable with the DL-MLP algorithm depicting the attributes’ most intricate spatial organization details, compared to the 1D-CNN model. Irrespective of the algorithms and datasets, the R2 and RMSE values of the pH attribute ranged from 0.15 to 0.30 and 0.97 to 1.15, respectively. Similarly, the R2 and RMSE of the OC attribute ranged from 0.20 to 0.39 and 0.38 to 0.42, respectively. Further, the overall accuracy (OA) of the order and suborder classification ranged from 39% to 67% and 35% to 64%, respectively. The explicit quantification of the covariate importance derived from the permutation feature importance implied that both the models tried to incorporate the covariate importance with respect to the genesis of the soil attribute under study. Such approaches of the deep learning models integrating soil–environmental relationships under limited parameterization and computing costs can serve as a baseline study, emphasizing opportunities in increasing the transferability and generalizability of the model while accounting for the associated environmental dependencies.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predicting Wind Turbine (WT) power output based on environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Along with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the following ML models were looked at: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). Using a dataset of 40,000 observations, the models were assessed based on R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). ET achieved the highest performance among ML models, with an R-squared value of 0.7231 and a RMSE of 0.1512. Among DL models, ANN demonstrated the best performance, achieving an R-squared value of 0.7248 and a RMSE of 0.1516. The results show that DL models, especially ANN, did slightly better than the best ML models. This means that they are better at modeling non-linear dependencies in multivariate data. Preprocessing techniques, including feature scaling and parameter tuning, improved model performance by enhancing data consistency and optimizing hyperparameters. When compared to previous benchmarks, the performance of both ANN and ET demonstrates significant predictive accuracy gains in WT power output forecasting. This study’s novelty lies in directly comparing a diverse range of ML and DL algorithms while highlighting the potential of advanced computational approaches for renewable energy optimization.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition is an advanced version of an artificial emotional intelligence system. Various solutions have been proposed to enhance the performance and emotion recognition rate. Multimodal is also one of the recent advanced research areas to classify and recognize emotions in realtime, consisting of physiological signals, facial expressions, audio-visual, audio-text, and video-text fusion. The proposed work uses advanced deep learning models to recognize the seven categorical emotions from the audio and video modality. Different modalities' feature extraction techniques and landmarks, such as Audio and Video, play a vital role in recognizing emotions. It also illustrates the Audio-video-based feature fusion mechanism. It computes the complementary relationship between the different modalities and shows the improved performance using the RESNET20 model for audio modality and the 3DCNN model for video modality on the RAVDESS dataset. Opensmile toolkit is used to extract the compelling features from the audio model and fuse them with extracted features of video modality. Feature fusion mechanism fuses the extracted features of audio and video data to classify and enhance the accuracy of recognized categorical emotions. It also briefly discusses the various audio-video features fusion approaches, computational accuracy and robustness of the proposed model. It shows a result of 71.3% and 69.7%. Accuracy on validation and test datasets outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the multimodal emotion recognition domain with a fusion mechanism.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "As a key technique for future networks, the performance of emerging multi-edge caching is often limited by inefficient collaboration among edge nodes and improper resource configuration. Meanwhile, achieving optimal cache hit rates poses substantive challenges without effectively capturing the potential relations between discrete user features and diverse content libraries. These challenges become further sophisticated when caching schemes are exposed to adversarial attacks that seriously impair cache performance. To address these challenges, we introduce RoCoCache, a resilient collaborative caching framework that uniquely integrates robust federated deep learning with proactive caching strategies, enhancing performance under adversarial conditions. First, we design a novel partitioning mechanism for multi-dimensional cache space, enabling precise content recommendations in user classification intervals. Next, we develop a new Discrete-Categorical Variational Auto-Encoder (DC-VAE) to accurately predict content popularity by overcoming posterior collapse. Finally, we create an original training mode and proactive cache replacement strategy based on robust federated deep learning. Notably, the residual-based detection for adversarial model updates and similarity-based federated aggregation are integrated to avoid the model destruction caused by adversarial updates, which enables the proactive cache replacement adapting to optimized cache resources and thus enhances cache performance. Using the real-world testbed and datasets, extensive experiments verify that the RoCoCache achieves higher cache hit rates and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods while ensuring better robustness. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the components designed in RoCoCache for improving cache performance via ablation studies.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we attempted to classify categorical emotional states using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals and a configurable Convolutional Neural Network (cCNN). The EDA signals from the publicly available, Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion dataset were down-sampled and decomposed into phasic components using the cvxEDA algorithm. The phasic component of EDA was subjected to Short-Time Fourier Transform-based time-frequency representation to obtain spectrograms. These spectrograms were input to the proposed cCNN to automatically learn the prominent features and discriminate varied emotions such as amusing, boring, relaxing, and scary. Nested k-Fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the robustness of the model. The results indicated that the proposed pipeline could discriminate the considered emotional states with a high average classification accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and F-measure scores of 80.20%, 60.41%, 86.8%, 60.05%, and 58.61%, respectively. Thus, the proposed pipeline could be valuable in examining diverse emotional states in normal and clinical conditions.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.",

We develop the theory of persistence categories as a natural generalization of persistence modules, establishing functorial relationships between classical topological invariants and their persistent counterparts. Our approach reveals deep connections between sheaf cohomology, spectral sequences, and multi-parameter persistence, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the stability and structure of topological features in data. We prove that persistent homology can be viewed as a particular instance of a more general categorical construction that encompasses both classical and computational topology. Furthermore, we establish new stability theorems for categorical persistence and demonstrate how classical results in algebraic topology can be lifted to the persistent setting through appropriate functorial constructions. We present practical applications in data science, computational biology, and machine learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our theoretical framework through concrete implementations and computational experiments.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Experimental results reveal that rocking shallow foundations reduce earthquake-induced force and flexural displacement demands transmitted to structures and can be used as an effective geotechnical seismic isolation mechanism. This paper presents data-driven predictive models for maximum acceleration transmitted to structures founded on rocking shallow foundations during earthquake loading. Results from base-shaking experiments on rocking foundations have been utilized for the development of artificial neural network regression (ANN), k-nearest neighbors regression, support vector regression, random forest regression, adaptive boosting regression, and gradient boosting regression models. Acceleration amplification ratio, defined as the maximum acceleration at the center of gravity of a structure divided by the peak ground acceleration of the earthquake, is considered as the prediction parameter. For five out of six models developed in this study, the overall mean absolute percentage error in predictions in repeated k-fold cross validation tests vary between 0.128 and 0.145, with the ANN model being the most accurate and most consistent. The cross validation mean absolute error in predictions of all six models vary between 0.08 and 0.1, indicating that the maximum acceleration of structures supported by rocking foundations can be predicted within an average error limit of 8% to 10% of the peak ground acceleration of the earthquake.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Physiological measurements have been widely used by researchers and practitioners in order to address the stress detection challenge. So far, various datasets for stress detection have been recorded and are available to the research community for testing and benchmarking. The majority of the stress-related available datasets have been recorded while users were exposed to intense stressors, such as songs, movie clips, major hardware/software failures, image datasets, and gaming scenarios. However, it remains an open research question if such datasets can be used for creating models that will effectively detect stress in different contexts. This paper investigates the performance of the publicly available physiological dataset named WESAD (wearable stress and affect detection) in the context of user experience (UX) evaluation. More specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) and skin temperature (ST) signals from WESAD were used in order to train three traditional machine learning classifiers and a simple feed forward deep learning artificial neural network combining continues variables and entity embeddings. Regarding the binary classification problem (stress vs. no stress), high accuracy (up to 97.4%), for both training approaches (deep-learning, machine learning), was achieved. Regarding the stress detection effectiveness of the created models in another context, such as user experience (UX) evaluation, the results were quite impressive. More specifically, the deep-learning model achieved a rather high agreement when a user-annotated dataset was used for validation.",

This study focuses on the objectives of computer vision systems: replicating human visual capabilities including recognition, comprehension, and interpretation. Notably, image classification, object detection, and image segmentation are crucial tasks requiring robust mathematical foundations. Despite the advancements, challenges persist, such as clarifying terminology related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Precise definitions and interpretations are vital for establishing a solid research foundation. The evolution of machine vision reflects an ambitious journey to emulate human visual perception.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules. The term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced by computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by identity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of its semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of encoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and properties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt Richard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We prove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural 2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the semantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map 2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified by Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we obtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises Garner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the interpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is well-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a semantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not admissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types but does not believe intensional ones.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Using dependent type theory to formalise the syntax of dependent type theory is a very active topic of study and goes under the name of \"type theory eating itself\" or \"type theory in type theory.\" Most approaches are at least loosely based on Dybjer’s categories with families (CwF’s) and come with a type Con of contexts, a type family Ty indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This works well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity proofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a long-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory \"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying difficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type theory in the absence of UIP.In this paper, we develop a notion of ∞-categories with families (∞-CwF’s). The approach to higher categories used relies on the previously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity substitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The type-theoretic universe as well as the internalised (set-level) syntax are models, although it remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known unsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is presented in two-level type theory (2LTT).Apart from introducing ∞-CwF’s, the paper explains the shortcomings of 1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and approaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

    "title": "Foundations of Substructural Dependent Type Theory",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This paper presents preliminary work on a general system for integrating dependent types into substructural type systems such as linear logic and linear type theory. Prior work on this front has generally managed to deliver type systems possessing either syntax or semantics inclusive of certain practical applications, but has struggled to combine these all in one and the same system. Toward resolving this difficulty, I propose a novel categorical interpretation of substructural dependent types, analogous to the use of monoidal categories as models of linear and ordered logic, that encompasses a wide class of mathematical and computational examples. On this basis, I develop a general framework for substructural dependent type theories, and proceed to prove some essential metatheoretic properties thereof. As an application of this framework, I show how it can be used to construct a type theory that satisfactorily addresses the problem of effectively representing cut admissibility for linear sequent calculus in a logical framework.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Using dependent type theory to formalise the syntax of dependent type theory is a very active topic of study and goes under the name of\"type theory eating itself\"or\"type theory in type theory.\"Most approaches are at least loosely based on Dybjer's categories with families (CwF's) and come with a type CON of contexts, a type family TY indexed over it modelling types, and so on. This works well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity proofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a long-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\"eats itself\"and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying difficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type theory in the absence of UIP. In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families ($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the previously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity substitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The type-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although it remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known unsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is presented in two-level type theory (2LTT). Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, this paper is meant to serve as a\"gentle introduction\"to shortcomings of 1-categories in type theory without UIP, and to difficulties of and approaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reflect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as first-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper defines a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain fibrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [28] constitutes an example of such a fibration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "\n Locally cartesian closed (lcc) categories are natural categorical models of extensional dependent type theory. This paper introduces the “gros” semantics in the category of lcc categories: Instead of constructing an interpretation in a given individual lcc category, we show that also the category of all lcc categories can be endowed with the structure of a model of dependent type theory. The original interpretation in an individual lcc category can then be recovered by slicing. As in the original interpretation, we face the issue of coherence: Categorical structure is usually preserved by functors only up to isomorphism, whereas syntactic substitution commutes strictly with all type-theoretic structures. Our solution involves a suitable presentation of the higher category of lcc categories as model category. To that end, we construct a model category of lcc sketches, from which we obtain by the formalism of algebraically (co)fibrant objects model categories of strict lcc categories and then algebraically cofibrant strict lcc categories. The latter is our model of dependent type theory.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The metatheory of dependent types has seen a lot of progress in recent years. In particular, the development of categorical gluing finally lets us work with semantic presentations of type theory (such as categories with families) to establish fundamental properties of type theory such as canonicity and normalisation. However, proofs by gluing have yet to reach the stage of computer formalisation: formal proofs for the metatheory of dependent types are still stuck in the age of tedious syntactic proofs. The main reason for this is that semantic presentations of type theory are defined using sophisticated indexed inductive types, which are especially prone to \"transport hell\". In this paper, we introduce a new technique to work with CwFs in intensional type theory without getting stuck in transport hell. More specifically, we construct an alternative presentation of the initial CwF which encodes the substitutions as metatheoretical functions. This has the effect of strictifying all the equations that are involved in the substitution calculus, which greatly reduces the need for transports. As an application, we use our strictified initial CwF to give a short and elegant proof of canonicity for a type theory with dependent products and booleans with large elimination. The resulting proof is fully formalised in Agda.",

    "abstract": "The program of internal type theory seeks to develop the categorical model theory of dependent type theory using the language of dependent type theory itself. In the present work we study internal homotopical type theory by relaxing the notion of a category with families (cwf) to that of a wild, or precoherent higher cwf, and determine coherence conditions that suffice to recover properties expected of models of dependent type theory. The result is a definition of a split 2-coherent wild cwf, which admits as instances both the syntax and the\"standard model\"given by a universe type. This will allow us to give a straightforward internalization of the notion of a 2-coherent reflection of homotopical type theory in itself: namely as a 2-coherent wild cwf morphism from the syntax to the standard model. Our theory also easily specializes to give definitions of\"low-dimensional\"higher cwfs, and conjecturally includes the container higher model as a further instance.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \\emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \\emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \\emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze and compare three of the many algebraic structures that have been used for modeling dependent type theories: categories with families, split type-categories, and representable maps of presheaves. We study these in univalent type theory, where the comparisons between them can be given more elementarily than in set-theoretic foundations. Specifically, we construct maps between the various types of structures, and show that assuming the Univalence axiom, some of the comparisons are equivalences. We then analyze how these structures transfer along (weak and strong) equivalences of categories, and, in particular, show how they descend from a category (not assumed univalent/saturated) to its Rezk completion. To this end, we introduce relative universes, generalizing the preceding notions, and study the transfer of such relative universes along suitable structure. We work throughout in (intensional) dependent type theory; some results, but not all, assume the univalence axiom.

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "We develop a dependent type theory that is based purely on inductive and coinductive types, and the corresponding recursion and corecursion principles. This results in a type theory with a small set of rules, while still being fairly expressive. For example, all well-known basic types and type formers that are needed for using this type theory as a logic are definable: propositional connectives, like falsity, conjunction, disjunction, and function space, dependent function space, existential quantification, equality, natural numbers, vectors etc. The reduction relation on terms consists solely of a rule for recursion and a rule for corecursion. The reduction relations for well-known types arise from that. To further support the introduction of this new type theory, we also prove fundamental properties of its term calculus. Most importantly, we prove subject reduction and strong normalisation of the reduction relation, which gives computational meaning to the terms.The presented type theory is based on ideas from categorical logic that have been investigated before by the first author, and it extends Hagino’s categorical data types to a dependently typed setting. By basing the type theory on concepts from category theory we maintain the duality between inductive and coinductive types, and it allows us to describe, for example, the function space as a coinductive type.",

A (co)monad is determined by an adjunction and further determines a specific type of adjunction called the (co)Kleisli adjunction. Mac Lane introduced the comparison theorem which allows comparing these adjunctions bridged by a (co)monad through a unique comparison functor. In this paper we specify the foundations of category theory in Coq and show that the chosen representations are useful by certifying Mac Lane’s comparison theorem and its basic consequences. We also show that the foundations we use are equivalent to the foundations by Timany. The formalization makes use of Coq classes to implement categorical objects and the axiom uniqueness of identity proofs to close the gap between the contextual equality of objects in a categorical setting and the judgmental Leibniz equality of Coq. The theorem is used by Duval and Jacobs in their categorical settings to interpret the state effect in impure programming languages.",

Our topic is a theory showing “where adjoints come from”. The theory is based on object-to-object “chimera morphisms”, “heteromorphisms”, or “hets” between the objects of different categories (e.g., the insertion of generators as a set-to-group map). After showing that heteromorphisms can be treated rigorously using the machinery of category theory (bifunctors), we show that all adjunctions between two categories arise (up to an isomorphism) as the representations (i.e., universal models) within each category of the heteromorphisms between the two categories. The conventional treatment of adjunctions eschews the whole concept of a heteromorphism, so our purpose is to shine a new light on this notion by showing its origin as a het between categories being universally represented within each of the two categories. This heteromorphic treatment of adjunctions shows how they can be split into two separable universal constructions. Such universals can also occur without being part of an adjunction. We conclude with the idea that it is the universal constructions (adjunctions being an important special case) that are really the foundational concepts to pick out what is important in mathematics and perhaps in other sciences, not to mention in philosophy.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Traditional category theory is typically based on set-theoretic principles and ideas, which are often non-constructive. An alternative approach to formalizing category theory is to use E-category theory, where hom sets become setoids. Our work reconsiders a third approach - P-category theory - from \\v{C}ubri\\'c et al. (1998) emphasizing a computational standpoint. We formalize in Rocq a modest library of P-category theory - where homs become subsetoids - and apply it to formalizing algorithms for normalization by evaluation which are purely categorical but, surprisingly, do not use neutral and normal terms. \\v{C}ubri\\'c et al. (1998) establish only a soundness correctness property by categorical means; here, we extend their work by providing a categorical proof also for a strong completeness property. For this we formalize the full universal property of the free Cartesian-closed category, which is not known to have been performed before. We further formalize a novel universal property of unquotiented simply typed lambda-calculus syntax and apply this to a proof of correctness of a categorical normalization by evaluation algorithm. We pair the overall mathematical development with a formalization in the Rocq proof assistant, following the principle that the formalization exists for practical computation. Indeed, it permits extraction of synthesized normalization programs that compute (long) beta-eta-normal forms of simply typed lambda-terms together with a derivation of beta-eta-conversion.",

We explore the foundational methodologies of the Token Space, detailing its construction, the role of construction operators and initial categories, and its application in analyzing deep learning models, specifically focusing on attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures. The integration of category theory into AI research offers a unified framework to describe and analyze computational structures, enabling new research paths and development possibilities.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The growing complexity of modern practical problems puts high demand on mathematical modelling. Given that various models can be used for modelling one physical phenomenon, the role of model comparison and model choice is becoming particularly important. Methods for model comparison and model choice typically used in practical applications nowadays are computation-based, and thus time consuming and computationally costly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop other approaches to working abstractly, i.e., without computations, with mathematical models. An abstract description of mathematical models can be achieved by the help of abstract mathematics, implying formalisation of models and relations between them. In this paper, a category theory-based approach to mathematical modelling is proposed. In this way, mathematical models are formalised in the language of categories, relations between the models are formally defined and several practically relevant properties are introduced on the level of categories. Finally, an illustrative example is presented, underlying how the category-theory based approach can be used in practice. Further, all constructions presented in this paper are also discussed from a modelling point of view by making explicit the link to concrete modelling scenarios.",

We show that string diagrams are also useful in exploring fundamental properties of basic concepts in category theory, such as universal properties, (co)limits, Kan extensions, and (co)ends. For instance, string diagrams are utilized to represent visually intuitive proofs of the Yoneda lemma, necessary and sufficient conditions for being adjunctions, the fact that right adjoints preserve limits (RAPL), and necessary and sufficient conditions for having pointwise Kan extensions. We also introduce a method for intuitively calculating (co)ends using diagrammatic representations and employ it to prove several properties of (co)ends and weighted (co)limits. This paper proposes that using string diagrams is an effective approach for beginners in category theory to learn the fundamentals of the subject in an intuitive and understandable way.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical morphology contributes many profitable tools to image processing area. Some of these methods considered to be basic but the most important fundamental of data processing in many various applications. In this paper, we modify the fundamental of morphological operations such as dilation and erosion making use of limit and co-limit preserving functors within (Category Theory). Adopting the well-known matrix representation of images, the category of matrix, called Mat, can be represented as an image. With enriching Mat over various semirings such as Boolean and (max,+) semirings, one can arrive at classical definition of binary and gray-scale images using the categorical tensor product in Mat. With dilation operation in hand, the erosion can be reached using the famous tensor-hom adjunction. This approach enables us to define new types of dilation and erosion between two images represented by matrices using different semirings other than Boolean and (max,+) semirings. The viewpoint of morphological operations from category theory can also shed light to the claimed concept that mathematical morphology is a model for linear logic.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks. The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries. The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Optics and lenses are abstract categorical gadgets that model systems with bidirectional data flow. In this paper we observe that the denotational definition of optics - identifying two optics as equivalent by observing their behaviour from the outside - is not suitable for operational, software oriented approaches where optics are not merely observed, but built with their internal setups in mind. We identify operational differences between denotationally isomorphic categories of cartesian optics and lenses: their different composition rule and corresponding space-time tradeoffs, positioning them at two opposite ends of a spectrum. With these motivations we lift the existing categorical constructions and their relationships to the 2-categorical level, showing that the relevant operational concerns become visible. We define the 2-category $\\textbf{2-Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ whose 2-cells explicitly track optics' internal configuration. We show that the 1-category $\\textbf{Optic}(\\mathcal{C})$ arises by locally quotienting out the connected components of this 2-category. We show that the embedding of lenses into cartesian optics gets weakened from a functor to an oplax functor whose oplaxator now detects the different composition rule. We determine the difficulties in showing this functor forms a part of an adjunction in any of the standard 2-categories. We establish a conjecture that the well-known isomorphism between cartesian lenses and optics arises out of the lax 2-adjunction between their double-categorical counterparts. In addition to presenting new research, this paper is also meant to be an accessible introduction to the topic.",

    "abstract": "Most texts on Category Theory are written in a very terse style, in which people pretend a) that all concepts are visualizable, and b) that the readers can reconstruct the diagrams that the authors had in mind based on only the most essential cues. As an outsider I spent years be-lieving that the techniques for drawing diagrams were part of the oral culture of the ﬁeld, and that the insiders could read texts on CT reconstructing the “missing diagrams” in them line by line and paragraph by paragraph, and drawing for each page of text a page of diagrams with all the diagrams that the authors had omitted. My belief was wrong: there are lots of conventions for drawing diagrams scattered through the literature, but that uniﬁed diagrammatic language did not exist. In this chapter I will show an attempt to reconstruct that (imaginary) language for missing diagrams: we will see an extensible diagrammatic language, called DL, that follows the conventions of the diagrams in the literature of CT whenever possible and that seems to be adequate for drawing “missing diagrams” for Category Theory. Our examples include the “missing diagrams” for adjunctions, for the Yoneda Lemma, for Kan extensions, and for geometric morphisms, and how to formalize them in Agda.",

This extends the previous results of Houston in the symmetric case, and addresses a question of his. It also extends the results in the non-symmetric case with additional finiteness assumptions, obtained by Benson–Etingof–Ostrik, Coulembier, and Ko–Mazorchuk–Zhang. We give an interpretation of these results using comonad cohomology, and, in the absence of finiteness conditions, using enriched traces of monoidal categories. As an application of our results, we give a characterization of finite tensor categories in terms of the finitary $2$-representation theory of Mazorchuk–Miemietz.",

    "abstract": "Univalence was first defined in the setting of homotopy type theory by Voevodsky, who also (along with Kapulkin and Lumsdaine) adapted it to a model categorical setting, which was subsequently generalized to locally Cartesian closed presentable $\\infty$-categories by Gepner and Kock. These definitions were used to characterize various $\\infty$-categories as models of type theories. We give a definition for univalent morphisms in finitely complete $\\infty$-categories that generalizes the aforementioned definitions and completely focuses on the $\\infty$-categorical aspects, characterizing it via representability of certain functors, which should remind the reader of concepts such as adjunctions or limits. \nWe then prove that in a locally Cartesian closed $\\infty$-category (that is not necessarily presentable) univalence of a morphism is equivalent to the completeness of a certain Segal object we construct out of the morphism, characterizing univalence via internal $\\infty$-categories, which had been considered in a strict setting by Stenzel. We use these results to study the connection between univalence and elementary topos theory. We also study univalent morphisms in the category of groups, the $\\infty$-category of $\\infty$-categories, and pointed $\\infty$-categories.",

    "abstract": "\n Given a differentially graded (DG)-category ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$, we introduce the bar category of modules ${\\overline{\\textbf{{Mod}}}-{\\mathcal{A}}}$. It is a DG enhancement of the derived category $D({{\\mathcal{A}}})$ of ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$, which is isomorphic to the category of DG ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$-modules with ${A_{\\infty }}$-morphisms between them. However, it is defined intrinsically in the language of DG categories and requires no complex machinery or sign conventions of ${A_{\\infty }}$-categories. We define for these bar categories Tensor and Hom bifunctors, dualisation functors, and a convolution of twisted complexes. The intended application is to working with DG-bimodules as enhancements of exact functors between triangulated categories. As a demonstration, we develop a homotopy adjunction theory for tensor functors between derived categories of DG categories. It allows us to show in an enhanced setting that given a functor $F$ with left and right adjoints $L$ and $R$, the functorial complex $FR \\xrightarrow{F{\\operatorname{act}}{R}} FRFR \\xrightarrow{FR{\\operatorname{tr}} - {\\operatorname{tr}}{FR}} FR \\xrightarrow{{\\operatorname{tr}}} {\\operatorname{Id}}$ lifts to a canonical twisted complex whose convolution is the square of the spherical twist of $F$.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous research has demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures exhibit categorical perception (CP) in their judgments of emotional faces. However, the extent to which this phenomenon characterises the judgments of facial expressions among East Asians remains relatively unexplored. Building upon recent findings showing that East Asians are more likely than Westerners to see a mixture of emotions in facial expressions of anger and disgust, the present research aimed to investigate whether East Asians also display CP for angry and disgusted faces. To address this question, participants from Canada and China were recruited to discriminate pairs of faces along the anger-disgust continuum. The results revealed the presence of CP in both cultural groups, as participants consistently exhibited higher accuracy and faster response latencies when discriminating between-category pairs of expressions compared to within-category pairs. Moreover, the magnitude of CP did not vary significantly across cultures. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the existence of CP for facial expressions in both East Asian and Western cultures, suggesting that CP is a perceptual phenomenon that transcends cultural boundaries. This research contributes to the growing literature on cross-cultural perceptions of facial expressions by deepening our understanding of how facial expressions are perceived categorically across cultures.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nCategorical perception (CP) manifests in various aspects of human cognition. While there is mounting evidence for CP in facial emotions, CP in vocal emotions remains understudied. The current study attempted to test whether individuals with a tonal language background perceive vocal emotions categorically and to examine how factors such as gender and age influence the plasticity of these perceptual categories.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis study examined the identification and discrimination performance of 24 Mandarin-speaking children (14 boys and 10 girls) and 32 adults (16 males and 16 females) when they were presented with three vocal emotion continua. Speech stimuli in each continuum consisted of 11 resynthesized Mandarin disyllabic words.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCP phenomena were detected when Mandarin participants perceived vocal emotions. We further found the modulating effect of age and gender in vocal emotion categorization.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results demonstrate for the first time that a categorical strategy is used by Mandarin speakers when perceiving vocal emotions. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the categorization ability of vocal emotions follows a prolonged course of development and the maturation patterns differ across genders. This study opens a promising line of research for investigating how sensory features are mapped to higher order perception and provides implications for our understanding of clinical populations characterized by altered emotional processing.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.27204057.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We intended to establish if two lexical tone contrasts in Zhumadian Mandarin, one between early and late aligned falls and another between early and late aligned rises, are perceived categorically, while the difference between declarative and interrogative pronunciations of these four tones is perceived gradiently. Presenting stimuli from 7-point acoustic continua between tones and between intonations, we used an identification task and a discrimination task with an experimental group of native listeners and a control group of Indonesian listeners, whose language employs none of the differences within either the falling or the rising pitch contours in its phonology. Only the lexical condition as perceived by the experimental group yielded sigmoid identification functions and a heightened discriminatory sensitivity around the midpoint of continua. The intonational condition in the native group and both conditions in the control group yielded gradient identification functions and smaller, reverse effects of the continuum midpoints in the discrimination task. The results are interpreted to mean that sentence modality contrasts can be expressed gradiently, but that lexical tone differences are represented phonologically, and hence are perceived categorically, despite low phonetic salience of the contrast. This conclusion challenges assumptions about the relation between linguistic functions and linguistic structures.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Categorical perception (CP) effects manifest as faster or more accurate discrimination between objects that come from different categories compared with objects that come from the same category, controlling for the physical differences between the objects. The most popular explanations of CP effects have relied on perceptual warping causing stimuli near a category boundary to appear more similar to stimuli within their own category and/or less similar to stimuli from other categories. Hanley and Roberson (2011), on the basis of a pattern not previously noticed in CP experiments, proposed an explanation of CP effects that relies not on perceptual warping, but instead on inconsistent usage of category labels. Experiments 1 and 2 in this article show a pattern opposite the one Hanley and Roberson pointed out. Experiment 3, using the same stimuli but with different choice statistics (i.e., different probabilities of each face being the target), obtains the same pattern as the one Hanley and Roberson showed. Simulations show that both category label and perceptual models are able to reproduce the patterns of results from both experiments, provided they include information about the choice statistics. This suggests 2 conclusions. First, the results described by Hanley and Roberson should not be taken as evidence in favor of a category label model. Second, given that participants did not receive feedback on their choices, there must be some mechanism by which participants monitor their own choices and adapt to the choice statistics present in the experiment.

There are several hypotheses about the causes of CP (e.g., language, learning, evolution) but no functional model.

We provide a model for learning-induced CP as expansion and compression of distances in hidden-unit space in neural nets. Basic conditions from which the current model predicts CP are described, and clues as to how these conditions might generalize to more complex kinds of categorization begin to emerge.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In Indonesia’s rapidly expanding cosmetic market, local brands face the dual challenge of competing with global beauty giants while appealing to increasingly identity-conscious consumers. This study investigates the drivers of purchase intention toward local cosmetic brands by integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Identity Theory (SIT), and Categorical Cognition Theory (CCT). Using data from 250 young Indonesian consumers and structural equation modeling, the study examines how Home Country Image (HCI) and Consumer Ethnocentrism (CE) influence purchase intention through Brand Image (BI), Product Belief (PB), and Attitude (ATT). Results reveal that HCI and CE significantly shape BI, PB, and ATT, but their influence on purchase intention is only realized when consumers hold strong beliefs in product quality. Surprisingly, brand image does not directly affect intention, challenging conventional wisdom in cosmetic marketing. This study contributes a novel multidimensional framework for understanding local brand loyalty in emerging markets and offers actionable insights for enhancing trust, cultural relevance, and competitiveness in the Indonesian beauty industry.",

    "year": 2010,
    "abstract": "Classical and Connectionist theories of cognitive architecture seek to explain systematicity (i.e., the property of human cognition whereby cognitive capacity comes in groups of related behaviours) as a consequence of syntactically and functionally compositional representations, respectively. However, both theories depend on ad hoc assumptions to exclude specific instances of these forms of compositionality (e.g. grammars, networks) that do not account for systematicity. By analogy with the Ptolemaic (i.e. geocentric) theory of planetary motion, although either theory can be made to be consistent with the data, both nonetheless fail to fully explain it. Category theory, a branch of mathematics, provides an alternative explanation based on the formal concept of adjunction, which relates a pair of structure-preserving maps, called functors. A functor generalizes the notion of a map between representational states to include a map between state transformations (or processes). In a formal sense, systematicity is a necessary consequence of a higher-order theory of cognitive architecture, in contrast to the first-order theories derived from Classicism or Connectionism. Category theory offers a re-conceptualization for cognitive science, analogous to the one that Copernicus provided for astronomy, where representational states are no longer the center of the cognitive universe—replaced by the relationships between the maps that transform them.",

    "year": 2011,
    "abstract": "A complete theory of cognitive architecture (i.e., the basic processes and modes of composition that together constitute cognitive behaviour) must explain the systematicity property—why our cognitive capacities are organized into particular groups of capacities, rather than some other, arbitrary collection. The classical account supposes: (1) syntactically compositional representations; and (2) processes that are sensitive to—compatible with—their structure. Classical compositionality, however, does not explain why these two components must be compatible; they are only compatible by the ad hoc assumption (convention) of employing the same mode of (concatenative) compositionality (e.g., prefix/postfix, where a relation symbol is always prepended/appended to the symbols for the related entities). Architectures employing mixed modes do not support systematicity. Recently, we proposed an alternative explanation without ad hoc assumptions, using category theory. Here, we extend our explanation to domains that are quasi-systematic (e.g., aspects of most languages), where the domain includes some but not all possible combinations of constituents. The central category-theoretic construct is an adjunction involving pullbacks, where the primary focus is on the relationship between processes modelled as functors, rather than the representations. A functor is a structure-preserving map (or construction, for our purposes). An adjunction guarantees that the only pairings of functors are the systematic ones. Thus, (quasi-)systematicity is a necessary consequence of a categorial cognitive architecture whose basic processes are functors that participate in adjunctions.",

There are many useful applications for this theory in cognitive science, and we want to introduce one such application to a broader audience. CT and the concepts used in this paper are introduced and explained. We show how the category theoretical concepts product and pullback can be used with the category of colored multigraphs to find possible analogies between domains using different requirements. The dual notion of a pullback, the pushout, is then used as conceptual blending to generate a new domain.",

While this article is by no means a comprehensive report on that event, the popularity of “Cats for AI” — the five introductory lectures on cats.for.ai have been viewed thousands of times — signals the growing prevalence of category theoretic tools in AI. One place where category theory is gaining traction in machine learning is by providing a formal way to discuss how learning systems can be put together. This article has a different and somewhat narrow focus. It’s about how a fundamental piece of AI technology used in language modeling can be understood, with the aid of categorical thinking, as a process that extracts structural features of language from purely syntactical input.

By extending these local categories into a unified two-category enriched with natural isomorphisms, the universal properties of logical operations such as negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication are rigorously captured. Advanced techniques including pseudo-limits, pseudo-colimits, and strictification are employed to transform the resulting weak structure into a strict two-category, thereby simplifying composition rules and coherence verification without loss of semantic content. The framework is validated through detailed diagrammatic proofs and concrete examples, demonstrating its robustness and potential impact in areas such as type theory, programming language semantics, and formal verification.",

    "abstract": "We develop foundations for oriented category theory, an extension of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-category theory obtained by systematic usage of the Gray tensor product, in order to study lax phenomena in higher category theory. As categorical dimension increases, classical category-theoretic concepts generally prove too rigid or fully break down and must be replaced by oriented versions, which allow more flexible notions of naturality and coherence. Oriented category theory provides a framework to address these issues. The main objects of study are oriented, and their conjugate antioriented, categories, which are deformations of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories where the various compositions only commute up to a coherent (anti)oriented interchange law. We give a geometric description of (anti)oriented categories as sheaves on a deformation of the simplex category $\\Delta$ in which the linear graphs are weighted by (anti)oriented cubes. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show that the categorical analogues of fundamental constructions in homotopy theory, such as cylinder and path objects, join and slice, and suspension and loops, are not functors of $(\\infty, \\infty)$-categories, but only of (anti)oriented categories, generalizing work of Ara, Guetta, and Maltsiniotis in the strict setting. As a main result we construct an embedding of the theory of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories into the theory of (anti)oriented categories and characterize the image, which we call (anti)oriented spaces. We provide an algebraic description of (anti)oriented spaces as (anti)oriented categories satisfying a strict (anti)oriented interchange law and a geometric description as sheaves on suitable categories of (anti)oriented polytopes, generalizing Grothendieck's philosophy of test categories to higher categorical dimension and refining Campion's work on lax cubes and suitable sites.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Network automation has become crucial in supporting services in 6G networks. This mainly derives from the complexity of the composition of numerous distributed virtual network functions (VNFs) in creating highly flexible virtual network services. Therefore, a network service automation system is a key technology enabler for 6G. However, the added complexity renders network service automation systems particularly sensitive to faults, some of which cause network outages that harm the smooth operation of basic societal services. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for fault detection can barely detect hidden faults. Herein, we propose a mechanism for automated network service analysis (ANSA), which constructs and analyzes a digital twin of a network service. The digital twin represents the available information about the network service based on category theory. It uses the properties of category theory to perform an analysis through which the faults of the network service are identified. We evaluate a prototype of a network service automation system that incorporates ANSA to demonstrate 1) the benefits of using digital twins for analyzing network services, 2) the benefits of using category theory for constructing digital twins of the network services, and 3) the resulting improvements in fault detection. Overall, ANSA can detect an average of 94% of the faults present in a network service. In comparison, previous SotA solutions can detect only 30%–50% of all faults.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The study of abstraction and composition - the focus of category theory - naturally leads to sophisticated diagrams which can encode complex algebraic semantics. Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems. Complex algebraic structures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we introduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communications (SC) offers a promising paradigm to amplify the resource efficiency of forthcoming wire-less systems by transmitting only messages that hold relevance to end users. Assessing the potential of SC systems necessitates a reevaluation of semantic information. Traditionally, semantic information has been confined to set-theoretic formulations, neglecting end users' deductive and abductive reasoning capacities. Contrary to the prior art, in this paper, a fresh framework for semantic information leveraging category theory and symbolic logic is introduced. In particular, we have proposed a neurosym-bolic artificial intelligence-based semantic communication (SC) system that encodes source data, represented as a set of logical statements, into a semantic representation. The symbolic component, structured as a first-order logical language, incorporates complex logical formulas designed to facilitate logical reasoning at the receiver nodes. Furthermore, a rigorous formulation of the semantics conveyed through the logical statements are developed through the concept of Fibrations. Finally, the mapping of the logical language onto a neural network space, while preserving the compositional structure of the language, is achieved using Grothendieck toposes in category theory. A novel formulation of semantic information is proposed, deriving it as the summation of represented information-which incorporates compositional knowledge enabled by the Grothendieck topos framework-and reasoned information.",

In this paper, we develop a compositional semantics for linearizable concurrent objects. We start by showcasing a common issue, which is independent of linearizability, in the construction of compositional models of concurrent computation: interaction with the neutral element for composition can lead to emergent behaviors, a hindrance to compositionality. Category theory provides a solution for the issue in the form of the Karoubi envelope. Surprisingly, and this is the main discovery of our work, this abstract construction is deeply related to linearizability and leads to a novel formulation of it. Notably, this new formulation neither relies on atomicity nor directly upon happens-before ordering and is only possible because of compositionality, revealing that linearizability and compositionality are intrinsically related to each other. We use this new, and compositional, understanding of linearizability to revisit much of the theory of linearizability, providing novel, simple, algebraic proofs of the locality property and of an analogue of the equivalence with observational refinement. We show our techniques can be used in practice by connecting our semantics with a simple program logic that is nonetheless sound concerning this generalized linearizability.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful, reconstructive approach. Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks, predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties. We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a research agenda for their unification.",

    "title": "Cognitive Biases in Software Engineering: Debiasing Through Reconception",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Background: Cognitive biases are systematic errors in reasoning that can lead to inaccurate decision-making across all areas of software production, regardless of the domain, programming language, or development method. Given the central role of software across all sectors, such biases can result in largescale inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs. Goal: While prior software engineering (SE) research predominantly focuses on specific tasks and quantitative methods, the vision of this paper is to study qualitatively how cognitive biases emerge, persist, and can be mitigated to improve decision-making throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Method: This vision uniquely applies the concept of reconception as a theoretical lens to explore how software professionals' cognitive models influence their management of dialectical oppositions, such as project velocity vs product quality and open-source vs proprietary control. Utilising Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) and dialectical inquiry, it examines how reconceiving these oppositions affects cognitive models and decision-making processes. Expected Outcome: A broad and high-level theoretical framework that explains how selected cognitive biases influence SE decision-making across the SDLC. The framework is developed through a two-phase STGT process: identifying salient bias categories in the first phase and focusing on the role of specific biases in shaping decision patterns in the second. This highlevel theory will open new research opportunities for future investigations into bias-informed decision-making in SE. Conclusion: This theoretical framework will support the development of empirically grounded debiasing strategies for more reliable decision-making in software engineering.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in systems’ complexity, leading to a rise in the need for more and more models. Models created with different intents are written using different formalisms and give diverse system representations. This work focuses on the system engineering domain and its models. It is crucial to assert a critical system’s compliance with its requirements. Thus, multiple models dedicated to these assertions are designed, such as safety or multi-physics models. As those models are independent of the architecture model, we need to provide means to assert and maintain consistency between them if we want the analyses to be relevant. The model synchronization methodologies give means to work on the consistency between the models through steps of abstraction to a common formalism, comparison, and concretization of the comparison results in the original models. This paper proposes a mathematical framework that allows for a formal definition of such a consistency relation and a mathematical description of the models. We use the context of category theory, as this is a mathematical theory providing great tools for taking into account different abstraction levels and composition of relations. Finally, we show how this mathematical framework can be applied to a specific synchronization methodology with a realistic study case.",

    "title": "Taxonomy-Based Human Error Assessment for Senior Software Engineering Students",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Software engineering (SE) is a complex symphony of development activities spanning multiple engineering phases. Despite best efforts, software engineers experience human errors. Human error theory from psychology has been studied in the context of SE, but human error assessment has yet to be adopted as part of typical post-mortem activities in SE. Our goal in this work is to evaluate an existing Taxonomy of Human Errors in Software Engineering (T.H.E.S.E.) as a learning tool for software engineering students. We conducted a user study involving five SE students at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In two experimental phases (17 weeks total), participants self-reported 162 human errors that they experienced during software development. Participants' feedback collected via surveys indicates that T.H.E.S.E. is clear, simple to use, and general to all phases of SE. Participants also indicated that human error assessment guided by T.H.E.S.E. (1) would benefit other students and professional software engineers and (2) enhanced their understanding of human errors in SE and of their own human errors. These are promising results indicating that human error assessment facilitated by T.H.E.S.E. is a valuable learning experience for software engineering students. We release anonymized survey responses and reported human errors. Future work should examine T.H.E.S.E. as a learning tool for professional software developers and examine other SE artifacts to identify categories of human error that are not presently captured by T.H.E.S.E.",

    "abstract": "Software engineering (SE) teaching includes different strategies such as project-based learning, collaborative learning, simulations, and case methods, among others, seeking to balance theory and practice and encourage teamwork. However, although some repositories of teaching practices are identified, each SE teacher incorporates different strategies/practices either barely documented or subjectively represented. The latter hinders the transfer of knowledge among the software engineering education community. Therefore, in this paper we propose SETMAT (Software Engineering Teaching Methods and Theory), a descriptive theory of SE education offering a common conceptual framework for representing software engineering teaching practices, and we also describe a pilot with teachers from Colombia, Chile, and Mexico where they represented and socialized their SE teaching practices in SETMAT. This pilot proves the usage of SETMAT for representing teaching practices easies comparison, composition, and transferring such practices. This poses an input of interest for SE education.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study addresses the urgent need for culturally informed educational technologies by proposing a web-based learning system designed to capture the rhythmic, tonal, and performative nuances of African music. Existing music software rarely accommodates Afrocentric elements such as ululation, call and response, and polyrhythmic layering, resulting in limited pedagogical effectiveness and the marginalization of Indigenous sonic knowledge. To bridge this gap, the research introduces a “musical engineering” framework that integrates Indigenous epistemologies into scoring algorithms and interactive learning modules. Guided by user-centered design, the Semiotic Theory of Music, and Episto Musical Pedagogy Theory, the study employs prototype development, usability testing, and contextual analysis. Findings show that African compositional idioms can be effectively encoded, represented, and taught through digital platforms when cultural logic informs system architecture. The resulting platform, AfriScore, supports notation, playback, and pedagogical feedback, offering a scalable model for music education and heritage preservation. Beyond safeguarding cultural knowledge, AfriScore demonstrates how embedding Indigenous epistemologies can enhance software functionality and user engagement, providing a replicable model for global educational technology design. Future research should examine cross-regional adaptation and integration into formal curricula.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Often in Software Engineering, a modeling formalism has to support scenarios of inconsistency in which several requirements either reinforce or contradict each other. Paraconsistent transition systems are proposed in this paper as one such formalism: states evolve through two accessibility relations capturing weighted evidence of a transition or its absence, respectively. Their weights come, parametrically, from a residuated lattice. This paper explores both i) a category of these systems, and the corresponding compositional operators and ii) a modal logic to reason upon them. Furthermore, two notions of crisp and graded simulation and bisimulation are introduced in order to relate two paraconsistent transition systems. Finally, results of modal invariance, for specific subsets of formulas, are discussed.",

It focuses on exploring how to guide students to utilize PRO/II in sensitivity analysis and systematically examine the key impacts of variables such as feed composition and operating pressure on separation efficiency and energy consumption. Teaching practice shows that this model can effectively cultivate students' engineering thinking, digital design capabilities, and comprehensive literacy in solving complex engineering problems, providing a valuable teaching plan for the cultivation of outstanding chemical engineers.",

    "title": "Design of Heterogeneous Cyber-Physical Systems Employing Category Theory",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous cyber-physical control systems based on digital twins are in demand by Industry 4.0. In accordance with the contemporary systems engineering methodology, such systems are designed at the level of digital models. The paper proposes approaches to formalization and subsequent automation of solving direct and inverse problems of their design. To unify descriptions of heterogeneous components, we follow a viewpoint-based approach to architecture design recommended by the international standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. Following recent trends, we employ category theory as a mathematical framework for the formal description and solution of design problems. Indeed, category theory is a branch of higher algebra specifically aimed at a unified representation of objects of different nature and relationships between them. The design space of a heterogeneous cyber-physical system is constructed as a subcategory of the multicomma category, the objects of which describe possible system architectures with a fixed structural hierarchy represented from a certain viewpoint as diagrams, and morphisms denote actions associated with the parts selection and replacement during the system design. Direct design problems consist in evaluating the properties of the system as a whole by its architecture and are solved using a universal category-theoretic construction of the colimit of the diagram. The solution of inverse problems that require finding variants of the system architecture, which are (sub-, Pareto-) optimal according to the consumer quality criteria, consists in reconstructing diagrams by their colimit edges. For such reconstruction, optimization algorithms of gradient descent type are reasonable to employ, which navigate along the system design space morphisms calculating the path by means of computer algebra. Typical techniques of assembling cyber-physical systems, such as modular composition and aspect weaving, are described in the language of category theory and illustrated. As an example, we outline the design of energy-efficient robotic production lines represented from the behavior viewpoint as discrete-event simulation models.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Identifier names are crucial components of code, serving as primary clues for developers to understand program behavior. This paper investigates the linguistic structure of identifier names by extending the concept of grammar patterns, which represent the part-of-speech (PoS) sequences underlying identifier phrases. The specific focus is on closed syntactic categories (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions, determiners), which are rarely studied in software engineering despite their central role in general natural language. To study these categories, the Closed Category Identifier Dataset (CCID), a new manually annotated dataset of 1,275 identifiers drawn from 30 open-source systems, is constructed and presented. The relationship between closed-category grammar patterns and program behavior is then analyzed using grounded-theory-inspired coding, statistical, and pattern analysis. The results reveal recurring structures that developers use to express concepts such as control flow, data transformation, temporal reasoning, and other behavioral roles through naming. This work contributes an empirical foundation for understanding how linguistic resources encode behavior in identifier names and supports new directions for research in naming, program comprehension, and education.",

MDE is a recent trend in software development, industrially supported by standards, tools, and the status of a new \"silver bullet\". Surprisingly, categorical patterns turn out to be directly applicable to mathematical modeling of structures appearing in everyday MDE practice. Model merging, transformation, synchronization, and other important model management scenarios can be seen as executions of categorical specifications. \nMoreover, the paper aims to elucidate a claim that relationships between CT and MDE are more complex and richer than is normally assumed for \"applied mathematics\". CT provides a toolbox of design patterns and structural principles of real practical value for MDE. We will present examples of how an elementary categorical arrangement of a model management scenario reveals deficiencies in the architecture of modern tools automating the scenario.",

    "abstract": "Software engineer is one of the highest in-demand manpower jobs in the world. As the prolonged COVID19 pandemic crisis, more and more people throughout the world became unemployed. There arises an incoming demand for reskilling and career shifting to software engineer. Online learning through MOOCs is, therefore, a viable and practical solution. However, reskilling to be a software engineer requires specific platform support that is able to develop both technical and non-technical skills, including management, communication, and teamwork, that traditional MOOCs cannot fulfill the challenges. This research aims to augment the traditional MOOCs with the additional use of personalization, collaboration, and gamification theory in the name of “CareerVio MOOCs Platform”. The distinct supports and services provided by the platform comprise team composition, team recomposition, team learning, and team assessments. CareerVio enables learners to master the necessary skills required in software engineer career, enhances the interaction between learners, and allows them to take what they have learned off the page and put it into practice.",

    "title": "The Human Side of Software Engineering Teams: An Investigation of Contemporary Challenges",
    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Context: There have been numerous recent calls for research on the human side of software engineering and its impact on various factors such as productivity, developer happiness and project success. An analysis of which challenges in software engineering teams are most frequent is still missing. As teams are more international, it is more frequent that their members have different human values as well as different communication habits. Additionally, virtual team setups (working geographically separated, remote communication using digital tools and frequently changing team members) are increasingly prevalent. Objective: We aim to provide a starting point for a theory about contemporary human challenges in teams and their causes in software engineering. To do so, we look to establish a reusable set of challenges and start out by investigating the effect of team virtualization. Virtual teams often use digital communication and consist of members with different nationalities that may have more divergent human values due to cultural differences compared to single nationality teams. Method: We designed a survey instrument and asked respondents to assess the frequency and criticality of a set of challenges, separated in context ”within teams” as well as ”between teams and clients”, compiled from previous empirical work, blog posts, and pilot survey feedback. For the team challenges, we asked if mitigation measures were already in place to tackle the challenge. Respondents were also asked to provide information about their team setup. The survey included the Personal Value Questionnaire to measure Schwartz human values. Finally, respondents were asked if there were additional challenges at their workplace. The survey was first piloted and then distributed to professionals working in software engineering teams via social networking sites and personal business networks. Result: In this article, we report on the results obtained from 192 respondents. We present a set of challenges that takes the survey feedback into account and introduce two categories of challenges; ”interpersonal” and ”intrapersonal”. We found no evidence for links between human values and challenges. We found some significant links between the number of distinct nationalities in a team and certain challenges, with less frequent and critical challenges occurring if 2-3 different nationalities were present compared to a team having members of just one nationality or more than three. A higher degree of virtualization seems to increase the frequency of some human challenges, which warrants further research about how to improve working processes when teams work from remote or in a distributed fashion. Conclusion: We present a set of human challenges in software engineering that can be used for further research on causes and mitigation measures, which serves as our starting point for a theory about causes of contemporary human challenges in software engineering teams. We report on evidence that a higher degree of virtualization of teams leads to an increase of certain challenges. This warrants further research to gather more evidence and test countermeasures, such as whether the employment of virtual reality software incorporating facial expressions and movements can help establish a less detached way of communication.",

Different definitions and many attempts were made in order to shape one concrete definition that serves as a reference. In the midst of this struggle, we propose a new attempt to define the emergence phenomenon from a software engineering perspective. Whereas many fields study the phenomenon based on observation and report, software systems engineering includes the fact that we are not only observing but further participating in the creation of the system of interest, giving a different perspective in defining and understanding the phenomenon. In this paper, we propose both informal and formal definitions, discuss some characteristics and list categories of the emergent behavior and how can we harness such a behavior.",

We performed a high level analysis to discover common themes in such papers and discovered that GT had been applied primarily in three software engineering disciplines: agile development processes, geographically distributed software development, and requirements engineering. For each category, we collected and analyzed all grounded theory codes and created, following a GT analysis process, what we call metacodes that can be used to drive further theory building.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This position paper examines the substantial divide between academia and industry within quantum software engineering. For example, while academic research related to debugging and testing predominantly focuses on a limited subset of primarily quantum-specific issues, industry practitioners face a broader range of practical concerns, including software integration, compatibility, and real-world implementation hurdles. This disconnect mainly arises due to academia's limited access to industry practices and the often confidential, competitive nature of quantum development in commercial settings. As a result, academic advancements often fail to translate into actionable tools and methodologies that meet industry needs. By analyzing discussions within quantum developer forums, we identify key gaps in focus and resource availability that hinder progress on both sides. We propose collaborative efforts aimed at developing practical tools, methodologies, and best practices to bridge this divide, enabling academia to address the application-driven needs of industry and fostering a more aligned, sustainable ecosystem for quantum software development.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Incorporating responsible practices into Software Engineering (SE) for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is essential to ensure ethical principles, societal impact, and accountability remain at the forefront of AI system design and deployment. This study investigates the ethical challenges and complexities inherent in Responsible Software Engineering (RSE) for AI, underscoring the need for practical, scenario-driven operational guidelines. Given the complexity of AI and the relative inexperience of professionals in this rapidly evolving field, continuous learning and market adaptation are crucial. Through qualitative interviews with seven practitioners (conducted until saturation), quantitative surveys of $\\mathbf{5 1}$ practitioners and static validation of results with four industry experts in AI, this study explores how personal values, emerging roles, and awareness of AI's societal impact influence responsible decision-making in RSE for AI. A key finding is the gap between the current state of the art and actual practice in RSE for AI, particularly in the failure to operationalize ethical and responsible decision-making within the Software Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) for AI. While ethical issues in RSE for AI largely mirror those found in broader SE process, the study highlights a distinct lack of operational frameworks and resources to guide RSE practices for AI effectively. The results reveal that current ethical guidelines are insufficiently implemented at the operational level, reinforcing the complexity of embedding ethics throughout the SELC. The study concludes that interdisciplinary collaboration, H-shaped competencies (Ethical-Technical dual competence), and a strong organizational culture of ethics are critical for fostering RSE practices for AI, with a particular focus on transparency and accountability.",

While some guidelines to address fairness have been proposed, achieving a comprehensive understanding of research solutions on fairness in AI models is trick. This paper presents a systematic literature mapping to explore and categorize the current advancements in fairness solutions in software engineering, focusing on two key elements: research trends and focus. We develop a classification framework to organize research on Software Fairness in a new perspective, applying it to 83 selected studies. As main result, we have found that researchers are creating practical AI solutions—specifically, framework solutions— focusing on group fairness metrics during the post-processing stage, these solutions are predominantly integrated during implementation and testing phases in software engineering process, with less attention to early stages like planning and design. Our results indicate a need to include fairness considerations throughout all stages of the software development lifecycle. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the field, laying a foundation for guiding future research and practical applications of fairness in software systems.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Empathy is a powerful yet often overlooked element in software engineering (SE), supporting better teamwork, smoother communication, and effective decision-making.This paper introduces 17 actionable empathy guidelines designed to support practitioners, teams, and organisations. We also explore how these guidelines can be implemented in practice by examining real-world applications, challenges, and strategies to overcome them shared by software practitioners. To support adoption, we present a visual prioritisation framework that categorises the guidelines based on perceived importance, ease of implementation, and willingness to adopt. The findings offer practical and flexible suggestions for integrating empathy into everyday SE work, helping teams move from principles to sustainable action.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Large Language Models are transforming software engineering, yet prompt management in practice remains ad hoc, hindering reliability, reuse, and integration into industrial workflows. We present Prompt-with-Me, a practical solution for structured prompt management embedded directly in the development environment. The system automatically classifies prompts using a four-dimensional taxonomy that encompasses intent, author role, software development lifecycle stage, and prompt type. To improve prompt reuse and quality, Prompt-with-Me suggests language refinements, masks sensitive information, and extracts reusable templates from a developer’s prompt library.Our taxonomy study of 1,108 real-world prompts demonstrates that modern LLMs can accurately classify software engineering prompts. Furthermore, our user study with 11 participants shows strong developer acceptance, with high usability (Mean SUS=73), low cognitive load (Mean NASA-TLX=21), and reported gains in prompt quality and efficiency through reduced repetitive effort. Lastly, we offer actionable insights for building the next generation of prompt management and maintenance tools for software engineering workflows.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Empathy plays a crucial role in software engineering (SE), influencing collaboration, communication, and decision-making. While prior research has highlighted the importance of empathy in SE, there is limited understanding of how empathy manifests in SE practice, what motivates SE practitioners to demonstrate empathy, and the factors that influence empathy in SE work. Our study explores these aspects through 22 interviews and a large scale survey with 116 software practitioners. Our findings provide insights into the expression of empathy in SE, the drivers behind empathetic practices, SE activities where empathy is perceived as useful or less relevant, and the other factors that influence empathy. In addition, we offer practical implications for SE practitioners and researchers, offering a deeper understanding of how to effectively integrate empathy into SE processes.",

    "title": "Federated Learning for Software Engineering: A Case Study of Code Clone Detection and Defect Prediction",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "In various research domains, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence, leading to the development of numerous learning-based models in research laboratories, which are evaluated using benchmark datasets. While the models proposed in previous studies may demonstrate satisfactory performance on benchmark datasets, translating academic findings into practical applications for industry practitioners presents challenges. This can entail either the direct adoption of trained academic models into industrial applications, leading to a performance decrease, or retraining models with industrial data, a task often hindered by insufficient data instances or skewed data distributions. Real-world industrial data is typically significantly more intricate than benchmark datasets, frequently exhibiting data-skewing issues, such as label distribution skews and quantity skews. Furthermore, accessing industrial data, particularly source code, can prove challenging for Software Engineering (SE) researchers due to privacy policies. This limitation hinders SE researchers’ ability to gain insights into industry developers’ concerns and subsequently enhance their proposed models. To bridge the divide between academic models and industrial applications, we introduce a federated learning (FL)-based framework called Almity. Our aim is to simplify the process of implementing research findings into practical use for both SE researchers and industry developers. Almity enhances model performance on sensitive skewed data distributions while ensuring data privacy and security. It introduces an innovative aggregation strategy that takes into account three key attributes: data scale, data balance, and minority class learnability. This strategy is employed to refine model parameters, thereby enhancing model performance on sensitive skewed datasets. In our evaluation, we employ two well-established SE tasks, i.e., code clone detection and defect prediction, as evaluation tasks. We compare the performance of Almity on both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models against two mainstream training methods, specifically the Centralized Training Method (CTM) and Vanilla Federated Learning (VFL), to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of Almity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework is not only feasible but also practical in real-world scenarios. Almity consistently enhances the performance of learning-based models, outperforming baseline training methods across all types of data distributions.",

Through 16 reflective interviews with SE students, we explored their academic experiences of using genAI tools to complement SE learning and implementations. We uncover the contexts where these tools are helpful and where they pose challenges, along with examining why these challenges arise and how they impact students.

    "abstract": "Lawvere's algebraic theories, or Lawvere theories, underpin a categorical approach to general algebra, and Lawvere's adjunction between semantics and algebraic structure leads to an equivalence between Lawvere theories and finitary monads on the category of sets. Several authors have transported these ideas to a variety of settings, including contexts of category theory enriched in a symmetric monoidal closed category. In this paper, we develop a general axiomatic framework for enriched structure-semantics adjunctions and monad-theory equivalences for subcategories of arities. Not only do we establish a simultaneous generalization of the monad-theory equivalences previously developed in the settings of Lawvere (1963), Linton (1966), Dubuc (1970), Borceux-Day (1980), Power (1999), Nishizawa-Power (2009), Lack-Rosick\\'y (2011), Lucyshyn-Wright (2016), and Bourke-Garner (2019), but also we establish a structure-semantics theorem that generalizes those given in the first four of these works while applying also to the remaining five, for which such a result has not previously been developed. Furthermore, we employ our axiomatic framework to establish broad new classes of examples of enriched monad-theory equivalences and structure-semantics adjunctions for subcategories of arities enriched in locally bounded closed categories, including various convenient closed categories that are relevant in topology and analysis and need not be locally presentable.",

    "abstract": "We develop a general framework for studying signatures, presentations, and algebraic colimits of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities, even when the base of enrichment $\\mathcal{V}$ is not locally presentable. When $\\mathcal{V}$ satisfies the weaker requirement of local boundedness, the resulting framework is sufficiently general to apply to the $\\Phi$-accessible monads of Lack and Rosick\\'y and the $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads of the first author, while even without local boundedness our framework captures in full generality the presentations of strongly finitary monads of Lack and Kelly as well as Wolff's presentations of $\\mathcal{V}$-categories by generators and relations. Given any small subcategory of arities $j : \\mathcal{J} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{C}$ in an enriched category $\\mathcal{C}$, satisfying certain assumptions, we prove results on the existence of free $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads, the monadicity of $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads over $\\mathcal{J}$-signatures, and the existence of algebraic colimits of $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads. We study a notion of presentation for $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monads and show that every such presentation presents a $\\mathcal{J}$-ary monad. Certain of our results generalize earlier results of Kelly, Power, and Lack for finitary enriched monads in the locally finitely presentable setting, as well as analogous results of Kelly and Lack for strongly finitary monads on cartesian closed categories. Our main results hold for a wide class of subcategories of arities in locally bounded enriched categories.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "Under a minimum of assumptions, we develop in generality the basic theory of universal algebra in a symmetric monoidal closed category $\\mathcal{V}$ with respect to a specified system of arities $j:\\mathcal{J} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{V}$. Lawvere's notion of algebraic theory generalizes to this context, resulting in the notion of single-sorted $\\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\\mathcal{J}$-cotensor theory, or $\\mathcal{J}$-theory for short. For suitable choices of $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{J}$, such $\\mathcal{J}$-theories include the enriched algebraic theories of Borceux and Day, the enriched Lawvere theories of Power, the equational theories of Linton's 1965 work, and the $\\mathcal{V}$-theories of Dubuc, which are recovered by taking $\\mathcal{J} = \\mathcal{V}$ and correspond to arbitrary $\\mathcal{V}$-monads on $\\mathcal{V}$. We identify a modest condition on $j$ that entails that the $\\mathcal{V}$-category of $\\mathcal{T}$-algebras exists and is monadic over $\\mathcal{V}$ for every $\\mathcal{J}$-theory $\\mathcal{T}$, even when $\\mathcal{T}$ is not small and $\\mathcal{V}$ is neither complete nor cocomplete. We show that $j$ satisfies this condition if and only if $j$ presents $\\mathcal{V}$ as a free cocompletion of $\\mathcal{J}$ with respect to the weights for left Kan extensions along $j$, and so we call such systems of arities eleutheric. We show that $\\mathcal{J}$-theories for an eleutheric system may be equivalently described as (i) monads in a certain one-object bicategory of profunctors on $\\mathcal{J}$, and (ii) $\\mathcal{V}$-monads on $\\mathcal{V}$ satisfying a certain condition. We prove a characterization theorem for the categories of algebras of $\\mathcal{J}$-theories, considered as $\\mathcal{V}$-categories $\\mathcal{A}$ equipped with a specified $\\mathcal{V}$-functor $\\mathcal{A} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{V}$.",

    "abstract": "In this chapter we discuss soft concept analysis, a study which identifies an enriched notion of \"conceptual scale\" as developed in formal concept analysis with an enriched notion of \"linguistic variable\" as discussed in fuzzy logic. The identification \"enriched conceptual scale\" = \"enriched linguistic variable\" was made in a previous paper (Enriched interpretation, Robert E. Kent). In this chapter we offer further arguments for the importance of this identification by discussing the philosophy, spirit, and practical application of conceptual scaling to the discovery, conceptual analysis, interpretation, and categorization of networked information resources. We argue that a linguistic variable, which has been defined at just the right generalization of valuated categories, provides a natural definition for the process of soft conceptual scaling. This enrichment using valuated categories models the relation of indiscernability, a notion of central importance in rough set theory. At a more fundamental level for soft concept analysis, it also models the derivation of formal concepts, a process of central importance in formal concept analysis. Soft concept analysis is synonymous with enriched concept analysis. From one viewpoint, the study of soft concept analysis that is initiated here extends formal concept analysis to soft computational structures. From another viewpoint, soft concept analysis provides a natural foundation for soft computation by unifying and explaining notions from soft computation in terms of suitably generalized notions from formal concept analysis, rough set theory and fuzzy set theory.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Selenium-rich foods play a crucial role in human health and hold significant economic value for agricultural products. However, many regions in China are experiencing selenium deficiency, which has led to an increased demand for Se-rich agricultural products. This study focused on Nanzhang County, a key area within the “Organic Valley” of Hubei Province, China. We employed fuzzy weights-of-evidence, backpropagation neural network, and support vector regression models to predict optimal planting zones for Selenium-rich crops. A comparative analysis indicated that the backpropagation neural network model provided the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.77), identifying Selenium-rich crop zones covering 68.87% of the aera, where Selenium-rich crops made up 86.67% of all samples. Notably, the backpropagation neural network yielded excellent performance for rice and rapeseed, with R2 values of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. The findings also indicate that the Selenium content in crops is closely linked to Selenium levels in the soil and is significantly influenced by synergistic and antagonistic interactions with other elements. This study provides scientific support for the cultivation of selenium-rich crops. It plays a positive role in promoting the development of the local selenium-rich industry and the sustainable utilization of soil selenium resources.",

I-SIMO converter provides both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) outputs from a single DC input source depending on the operation mode. It comprises two modes of operation, act as DC–DC converter in vehicle standby mode and DC–AC converter in vehicles driving mode.\n\n\nFindings\nThe use of PV panels in the vehicle helps to reduce dependence of grid supply as well as vehicle’s batteries. The proposed topology has to remove the multiple power conversion stages in EV system, reduce components count and provide dual outputs for enhancement of performance of EV system.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe proposed topology leads to reduction of switching losses and stresses across the components of the converter and provides reduction in system complexity and overall expenditure. So, it enhances the converter reliability and also improves the efficiency. The converter provides ripple-free output voltage under dynamic load condition. The performance of EET-FLC is studied by taking various performance measures such as rise time, peak time, settling time and peak overshoot and compared with conventional control designs.\n",

    "title": "Assessment and Validation of Shallow Groundwater Vulnerability to Contamination Based on Fuzzy Logic and DRASTIC Method for Sustainable Groundwater Management in Southeast Hungary",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "A hierarchical fuzzy inference system (FIS) integrated with the DRASTIC model is applied in this study to enhance the assessment of shallow groundwater vulnerability in southeast Hungary, a region characterized by extensive agriculture and industrial growth. Traditional groundwater vulnerability models often struggle with parameter imprecision and uncertainty, affecting their reliability. To address these limitations, fuzzy logic was incorporated to refine the classification of vulnerability zones. The hierarchical FIS incorporates the seven DRASTIC parameters: depth to the water table, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, vadose zone impact, and hydraulic conductivity, assigning flexible ratings through fuzzy membership functions. The model classifies the fuzzy groundwater vulnerability index (FGWVI) into low, moderate, and high categories, revealing that 63.9% of the study area is highly susceptible to contamination, particularly in regions with shallow water tables and sandy soils. Validation was conducted using nitrate (NO3−) concentrations and electrical conductivity (EC) measurements from 46 agricultural wells to assess the correlation between predicted vulnerability zones and actual groundwater quality indicators. The correlation analysis revealed a moderately strong positive relationship between FGWVI and both NO3− (R2 = 0.4785) and EC (R2 = 0.528), supporting the model’s ability to identify high-risk contamination zones. This study highlights the effectiveness of the fuzzy-enhanced DRASTIC model in evaluating aquifer vulnerability and provides crucial insights to assist policymakers in identifying pollution sources and developing strategies to mitigate groundwater contamination, thereby alleviating the stress on this critical resource.",

    "title": "A Fuzzy Logic Framework for Text-Based Incident Prioritization: Mathematical Modeling and Case Study Evaluation",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Incident prioritization is a critical task in enterprise environments, where textual descriptions of service disruptions often contain vague or ambiguous language. Traditional machine learning models, while effective in rigid classification, struggle to interpret the linguistic uncertainty inherent in natural language reports. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based framework for incident categorization and prioritization, integrating natural language processing (NLP) with a formal system of fuzzy inference. The framework transforms semantic embeddings from incident reports into fuzzy sets, allowing incident severity and urgency to be represented as degrees of membership in multiple categories. A mathematical model based on Mamdani-type inference and triangular membership functions is developed to capture and process imprecise inputs. The proposed system is evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising 10,000 incident descriptions from a mid-sized technology enterprise. A comparative evaluation is conducted against two baseline models: a fine-tuned BERT classifier and a traditional support vector machine (SVM). Results show that the fuzzy logic approach achieves a 7.4% improvement in F1-score over BERT (92.1% vs. 85.7%) and a 12.5% improvement over SVM (92.1% vs. 79.6%) for medium-severity incidents, where linguistic ambiguity is most prevalent. Qualitative analysis from domain experts confirmed that the fuzzy model provided more interpretable and context-aware classifications, improving operator trust and alignment with human judgment. These findings suggest that fuzzy modeling offers a mathematically sound and operationally effective solution for managing uncertainty in text-based incident management, contributing to the broader understanding of mathematical modeling in enterprise-scale social phenomena.",

This research develops a water quality monitoring system using the Mamdani fuzzy logic method based on three main parameters, namely temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The system was designed to handle the uncertainty and indecisiveness often encountered in water quality assessment, particularly in aquaculture environments. Temperature parameters are classified into cold, normal, and hot categories; pH into acidic, neutral, and alkaline categories; and DO into low, medium, and high categories. Simulation and implementation of the fuzzy inference system were conducted using MATLAB software. Through the process of fuzzification, rule-based inference, and defuzzification, the system successfully predicts the water quality status from bad, normal and good categories. The system is proven to be effective in evaluating water quality status and has the potential to support smarter and more adaptive management of koi fish farming environments.     ",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Power system stability is managed through various control loops, including the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), which regulates the terminal voltage of synchronous generators. This study integrated Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) and a Proportional–Integral–Derivative controller with Filtered derivative action (PIDF) to propose a hybrid Fuzzy PIDF controller enhanced by Fractional-Order Proportional-Derivative (FOPD) for AVR applications. For the first time, the newly introduced Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithm was applied to the AVR system to tune the parameters of the proposed fuzzy controller. The SCSO algorithm has been recognized as a powerful optimization tool and has demonstrated success across various engineering applications. The well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was also utilized in this study to optimize the gains of the proposed controller. The Fuzzy PIDF plus FOPD is a novel configuration that is designed to be a robust control technique for AVR to achieve an excellent performance. In this research, the Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller was optimized using the PSO and SCSO algorithms by minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) objective function to enhance the overall performance of AVR systems. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the proposed approach by benchmarking the results against those of other controllers reported in the literature. Furthermore, the robustness of the controller was assessed under parametric uncertainties and varying load disturbances. Also, its robustness was examined against disturbances in the control signal. The results demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller tuned by the PSO and SCSO algorithms delivers exceptional performance as an AVR controller, outperforming other controllers. Additionally, the findings confirm the robustness of the Fuzzy PIDF + FOPD controller against parametric uncertainties, establishing its potential for a successful implementation in real-time applications.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Two important Quality of Experience (QoE) parameters in computer networks service-related performance metrics are throughput and end-to-end delay. A slow delay indicates high network efficiency thus high throughput. Similarly, the entire four parameters linked to the integrity of service (Delay, Jitter, Packet Loss, and Throughput) are deliberated to be primary factors affecting almost all computer networks. The study's objective is to identify the vital primary parameters with preeminent results to be kept into consideration when analyzing Network QoE by using a fuzzy logic methodology. The tools used in the study were Linux MTR (my trace-route) tool for data extraction, Ms. Excel for data cleaning and presentation, MATLAB(matrix laboratory) software for plotting of functions/data, and creation of interfaces. A Fuzzy logic methodology was implemented using an experimental research design. The analysis of results using independent sample T-Test technique compared four primary parameters affecting any network to the two important QoE parameters. The results specified a significant consequence using the entire four Integrity of service parameters model compared to using a combination of two parameters model for consideration of network QoE whereby the p-value obtained was 0.017 which is less than 0.05. The target population for this model is the service providers enabling them to have the finest approachable measures to deal with network service providers to achieve QoS (Quality of service) in line with Service Level Agreement (SLAs) thus achieving finest network QoE.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) also known as heart disease are now the leading cause of death in the world. This paper presents research for the design and creation of a fuzzy logic-based expert system for the prognosis and diagnosis of heart disease that is precise, economical, and effective. This system entails a fuzzification module, knowledge base, inference engine, and defuzzification module where seven attributes such as chest pain type, HbA1c (Haemoglobin A1c), HDL (high-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), heart rate, age, and blood pressure are considered as input to the system. With the aid of the available literature and extensive consultation with medical experts in this field, an enriched knowledge database has been created with a sufficient number of IF-THEN rules for the diagnosis of heart disease. The inference engine then activates the appropriate IF-THEN rule from the knowledge base and determines the output value using the appropriate defuzzification technique after the fuzzification module fuzzifies each input depending on the appropriate membership function. Moreover, the fusion of web-based technology makes it suitable and cost-effective for the prognosis of heart disease for a patient and then he can take his decision for addressing the problem based on the status of his heart. On the other hand, it can also assist a medical practitioner to reach a more accurate conclusion regarding the treatment of heart disease for a patient. The Mamdani inference method has been used to evaluate the results. The system is tested with the Cleveland dataset and cross-checked with the in-field dataset. Compared with the other existing expert systems, the proposed method performs 98.08% accurately and can make accurate decisions for diagnosing heart diseases.",

That technique requires one to construct the vector space over powersets, and therefore is computationally costly. In this paper, we overcome this problem by considering fuzzy versions of quantifiers along the lines of Zadeh, within the category of many valued relations. We show that this category is a concrete instantiation of the compositional distributional model. We show that the semantics obtained in this model is equivalent to the semantics of the fuzzy quantifiers of Zadeh.

We formalise in this model the generalised quantifier theory of natural language, due to Barwise and Cooper. The underlying setting is a compact closed category with bialgebras. We start from a generative grammar formalisation and develop an abstract categorical compositional semantics for it, and then instantiate the abstract setting to sets and relations and to finite-dimensional vector spaces and linear maps. We prove the equivalence of the relational instantiation to the truth theoretic semantics of generalised quantifiers.

This paper deals with the topic of coordination between identical syntactic types, which accounts for the majority of coordination cases in language. By exploiting the compact closed structure of the underlying category and Frobenius operators canonically induced over the fixed basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces, we provide a morphism as representation of a coordinator tensor, and we show how it lifts from atomic types to compound types. Linguistic intuitions are provided, and the importance of the Frobenius operators as an addition to the compact closed setting with regard to language is discussed.",

The theoretical framework allows for reasoning about compositional aspects of language and offers structural ways of studying the underlying relationships. While the model so far has been applied on the level of syntactic structures, a sentence can bring extra information conveyed in utterances via intonational means. In the current paper we extend the framework in order to accommodate this additional information, using Frobenius algebraic structures canonically induced over the basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Taking advantage of the abstract categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation. \nThe new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts. This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our graded order. \nOur main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment.

    "abstract": "Distributional semantic models provide vector representations for words by gathering co-occurrence frequencies from corpora of text. Compositional distributional models extend these from words to phrases and sentences. In categorical compositional distributional semantics, phrase and sentence representations are functions of their grammatical structure and representations of the words therein. In this setting, grammatical structures are formalised by morphisms of a compact closed category and meanings of words are formalised by objects of the same category. These can be instantiated in the form of vectors or density matrices. This paper concerns the applications of this model to phrase and sentence level entailment. We argue that entropy-based distances of vectors and density matrices provide a good candidate to measure word-level entailment, show the advantage of density matrices over vectors for word level entailments, and prove that these distances extend compositionally from words to phrases and sentences. We exemplify our theoretical constructions on real data and a toy entailment dataset and provide preliminary experimental evidence.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "The provision of compositionality in distributional models of meaning, where a word is represented as a vector of co-occurrence counts with every other word in the vocabulary, offers a solution to the fact that no text corpus, regardless of its size, is capable of providing reliable co-occurrence statistics for anything but very short text constituents. The purpose of a compositional distributional model is to provide a function that composes the vectors for the words within a sentence, in order to create a vectorial representation that re ects its meaning. Using the abstract mathematical framework of category theory, Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark showed that this function can directly depend on the grammatical structure of the sentence, providing an elegant mathematical counterpart of the formal semantics view. The framework is general and compositional but stays abstract to a large extent. This thesis contributes to ongoing research related to the above categorical model in three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract framework based on Frobenius algebras (joint work with Sadrzadeh). The theory improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results. The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models thatfind intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work with Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in particular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum mechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different meanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and linguistics.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is about the problem of compositionality in distributional semantics. Distributional semantics presupposes that the meanings of words are a function of their occurrences in textual contexts. It models words as distributions over these contexts and represents them as vectors in high dimensional spaces. The problem of compositionality for such models concerns itself with how to produce representations for larger units of text by composing the representations of smaller units of text. \nThis thesis focuses on a particular approach to this compositionality problem, namely using the categorical framework developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark, which combines syntactic analysis formalisms with distributional semantic representations of meaning to produce syntactically motivated composition operations. This thesis shows how this approach can be theoretically extended and practically implemented to produce concrete compositional distributional models of natural language semantics. It furthermore demonstrates that such models can perform on par with, or better than, other competing approaches in the field of natural language processing. \nThere are three principal contributions to computational linguistics in this thesis. The first is to extend the DisCoCat framework on the syntactic front and semantic front, incorporating a number of syntactic analysis formalisms and providing learning procedures allowing for the generation of concrete compositional distributional models. The second contribution is to evaluate the models developed from the procedures presented here, showing that they outperform other compositional distributional models present in the literature. The third contribution is to show how using category theory to solve linguistic problems forms a sound basis for research, illustrated by examples of work on this topic, that also suggest directions for future research.",

To achieve this we introduce a notion of basic anaphoric discourses as a mid-level representation between natural language discourse formalised in terms of basic discourse representation structures (DRS); and knowledge base queries over the Semantic Web as described by basic graph patterns in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This provides a high-level specification for compositional algorithms for question answering and anaphora resolution, and allows us to give a picture of natural language understanding as a process involving both statistical and logical resources.",

Автор зробив критичний огляд термінів «екосистема мови», «біолінгвістична традиція»; вказано на потенційні негативні ризики адаптації біоморфних метафор у мовну політику, оскільки об’єктивізація, перерахування та біологізація мов робить їх природними об’єктами, а не культурними артефактами. Акцентовано, що екологічний термін є елементом екологічної терміносистеми, називає спеціальне поняття і вимагає чіткої дефініції. Збереження первинного науково-природничого змісту понять «екологія», «екосистема» є необхідним, оскільки розв’язання екологічних проблем потребує визначення й інтенсифікації тих напрямів досліджень, де можна віднайти шляхи природовідповідного існування людства. Вказано на перспективність практичного застосування екологічного дискурсу у викладацькій практиці, лексикографічній роботі, формуванні за «принципом доповнювальності» у носіїв мови soft skills у вигляді культури мови, національної єдності, екологічних цінностей.",

    "abstract": "The role of types in categorical models of meaning is investigated. A general scheme for how typed models of meaning may be used to compare sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure is described, and a toy example is used as an illustration. Taking as a starting point the question of whether the evaluation of such a type system 'loses information', we consider the parametrized typing associated with connectives from this viewpoint. \nThe answer to this question implies that, within full categorical models of meaning, the objects associated with types must exhibit a simple but subtle categorical property known as self-similarity. We investigate the category theory behind this, with explicit reference to typed systems, and their monoidal closed structure. We then demonstrate close connections between such self-similar structures and dagger Frobenius algebras. In particular, we demonstrate that the categorical structures implied by the polymorphically typed connectives give rise to a (lax unitless) form of the special forms of Frobenius algebras known as classical structures, used heavily in abstract categorical approaches to quantum mechanics.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Inquiry performs one of the backbones in current E-commerce websites. Detecting spams in inquiries is essential for these platforms but is surprisingly underexplored by current research. In this paper, we propose a system coined ISTBEL to detect spam inquiries. Motivated by the observations on both behavioral and linguistic differences between spammers and benign users, ISTBEL jointly utilizes the temporal-categorical behavioral sequence and text sequence to accomplish its purpose. At its heart, a variant of LSTM equipped interactive attentions is devised to strengthen the coherence between the categorical and temporal behaviors. A character-level CNN is adopted to capture the capricious linguistic patterns. These two modules are integrated and collaboratively contribute to the final predictions. Our system is trained through an end-to-end manner and can directly utilize raw data as input without tedious feature engineering. We have applied the system to inquiry spam detection on Alibaba.com, and results show ISTBEL is promising in detection spammers and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Meanwhile, ISTBEL can be easily applied to other applications which contain both behavioral and linguistic information.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This research offers a detailed functional and categorical analysis of particles in spoken Sinhala, emphasising their essential role in the language's syntax and semantics. Sinhala particles are non-inflecting elements that attach to nominal or verbal constituents, serving various communicative functions. Through authentic spoken data, the study identifies eight distinct categories of particles: case, predicative, highlighting, conjunctive, discourse, interrogative, quotative, and negative particles. The analysis demonstrates how these particles contribute significantly to the clarity, coherence, and expressiveness of spoken Sinhala. Despite their small size and lack of inflexion, particles play a crucial role in organising discourse, marking pragmatic nuances, and shaping meaning. This study fills a gap in Sinhala linguistics by providing comprehensive examples and categorisation based on real language use. The findings have important implications for linguistic theory, language teaching, and the development of natural language processing tools for Sinhala. Future research is recommended to explore particle usage across dialects, social contexts, and historical development.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "We present a new theoretical framework that unifies category-theoretic fixed-point constructions, transfinite recursion, and game-based semantics to model how interpretations of language can stabilize through unlimited self-reference. By iterating a meaning-refinement operator across all ordinal stages, we isolate a unique\"transordinal\"fixed point and show, via a hierarchy of reflective games, that this same object is the sole equilibrium of an infinite dialogue between a text and its interpreter. The result delivers a mathematically rigorous account of semantic convergence without resorting to statistical training or empirical benchmarks, yet remains simple to explain: start with a rough meaning, let speaker and listener correct each other forever, and the process provably settles on a single, self-consistent interpretation. Because the construction is entirely symbolic, it offers both precise guarantees for formal linguistics and a blueprint for designing language-aware systems that can reason about their own outputs. The paper details the requisite transordinal machinery, proves existence and uniqueness theorems, and connects them to long-standing questions about reflection, truth, and equilibrium in formal systems and semantics.",

Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of {\\Delta} = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields.

Our models can be seen as a variant of Montague semantics based on a lambda calculus where the primitives act on string diagrams rather than logical formulae. As a special case, we show how to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for first-order logic. This allows us to give a purely diagrammatic treatment of higher-order and non-linear processes in natural language semantics: adverbs, prepositions, negation and quantifiers. The definition presented in this article comes with a proof-of-concept implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for string diagrams.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Lexical disambiguation is one of the oldest problems in natural language processing. There are three main types of lexical ambiguity: part-of-speech ambiguity, homonymy, and polysemy, typically divided into two tasks in practice. While this division suffices for engineering purposes, it does not align well with human intuition. In this article, I use lexical ambiguity as a representative case to demonstrate how insights from theoretical linguistics can be helpful for developing more human-like meaning and knowledge representations in natural language understanding. I revisit the three types of lexical ambiguity and propose a structured reclassification of them into two levels using the theoretical linguistic tool of root syntax. Recognizing the uneven expressive power of root syntax across these levels, I further translate the theoretical linguistic insights into the language of category theory, mainly using the tool of topos. The resulting unified categorical representation of lexical ambiguity preserves rootsyntactic insights, has strong expressive power at both linguistic levels, and can potentially serve as a bridge between theoretical linguistics and natural language understanding. ",

Thus, we research the application of DisCoCat models in both quantum and classical natural language processing. Specifically, in classical and quantum natural language processing, we respectively converted sentences into tensor networks and quantum circuits based on the DisCoCat model to get representation containing both semantic and syntactic information of language in classical and quantum computer.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This study presents data format of episodic memory for artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of\"actions\"represented by verbs in natural languages and\"participants\"who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The study is devoted to the consideration of the terms, which are the most frequently used and significant for the formation of meaning in linguistics. The relevance of the study is, on the one hand, determined by the variety of approaches to their definition and interpretation, and, on the other hand, by the necessity to specify them to facilitate academic communication and linguistic analysis. The purpose of this work is to consider a number of such concepts and substantiate our approach to them and their interpretation. The study uses both general theoretical and linguistic research methods. Particular attention is paid to phenomenological analysis while considering the terms themselves, as well as semantic, categorical-constitutive, positional and pragmatic analysis while studying empirical material. There are considered the concepts of text, discourse, dicteme as a text unit, language personality of an author, or a narrator and a reader/listener. The article analyzes differences between the text and discourse concepts. The work substantiates heuristic potential of a dicteme as a minimum text unit. The dicteme is studied both - from elementary and holistic approaches, as a fractal that forms the space of the whole text according to synergistic laws. The study emphasizes the ideological role of a linguistic personality both at the stages of creation and consumption of a text. There is carried out a linguistic analysis of an English literary text in order to identify denotative and conceptual information in its ideological and aesthetic manifestation in it. The study highlights the role of strong positions of text in the transfer of conceptual information and considers the function of influence in an artistic and media works, which, in the first case, is mainly emotive in nature, and, in the second, manipulative. It underlines the interdependence of the conceptual priorities of the creator and consumer of a media text.",

    "abstract": "The article presents the theoretical foundations of the paradigmatic interdependence of contact and areal linguistics. The experience of scientific understanding of the spatial approach to the study of various aspects of language contact allows us to identify a tendency towards universalization of the conceptual apparatus of contact linguistics, as well as the correlation of the latter with the areal interpretation of the dialect landscape. It is emphasized that in the hierarchy of disciplines involved in the analysis of the processes and results of linguistic interaction, contact linguistics occupies a higher position. In this regard, the feasibility of integrating individual terms of this subject area into the categorical plane of areal linguistics is substantiated: the multifunctionality of the basic unit of contact linguistics – contacteme – makes it possible, firstly, to more objectively and accurately qualify complex areal phenomena (for example, when the stimulus for the emergence of innovation emanating from the source language is not equivalent to the result in the destination language), secondly, do not narrow the problem of language contacts to the issue of borrowings and bilingualism. Special attention is paid to the peculiarities of the terminological system of the described scientific fields. A number of issues are considered regarding the definition of the linguistic essence of the key concepts “contact zone”, “borrowing”, “infiltration”, etc. It is established that the term “contact zone” has conceptual significance not only for arealological studies, in a broader context it is included in the system concepts of contactology.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the characteristic of a new integrative area of linguistics – linguometaphorology, in which a theoretical and methodological base as well as a categorical and terminological apparatus are gradually being formed, empirical material is accumulating. However, many theoretical provisions require scientific rethinking, generalization, and systematization, while terminology needs clarification and unification. Based on the analysis of the main linguometaphorological works, the leading directions and current problems of linguometaphorology, basic methods of studying metaphorics are described, and dynamics of this branch of linguistics development is predicted. \nThe analysis of linguometaphorological researchs of the late 20th–21st centuries shows that the study of metaphors is most productively carried out in the semantic and cognitive directions. The author of this paper develops a semantic-cognitive approach to the study of metaphors, the relevance of which is due to the objective necessity of its theoretical understanding as a single mental-verbal construct. \nThe current problems of linguometaphorology are as follows: defining the essence of metaphor; establishing the principles of modelling metaphorization and the parameters of metaphorical models; clarifying the specifics of the metaphorical picture of the world; identifying the features of metaphorical conceptualization; developing methods and techniques for the complex analysis of metaphorics; developing the principles of the lexicographic description of metaphors and compiling metaphorical dictionaries. The methodology of linguometaphorology, which is developing in various directions, is based on such linguistic methods as componential analysis, contextual analysis, linguistic (semantic, cognitive, semantic-cognitive) modelling. \nIt is promising to continue linguometaphorological research in semantic, cognitive, semantic-cognitive and lexicographic aspects. Further development of linguometaphorology will allow to get a deeper understanding of the nature and mechanisms of figurative-metaphorical thinking",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Dynamical systems---by which we mean machines that take time-varying input, change their state, and produce output---can be wired together to form more complex systems. Previous work has shown how to allow collections of machines to reconfigure their wiring diagram dynamically, based on their collective state. This notion was called \"mode dependence\", and while the framework was compositional (forming an operad of re-wiring diagrams and algebra of mode-dependent dynamical systems on it), the formulation itself was more \"creative\" than it was natural. \nIn this paper we show that the theory of mode-dependent dynamical systems can be more naturally recast within the category Poly of polynomial functors. This category is almost superlatively abundant in its structure: for example, it has \\emph{four} interacting monoidal structures $(+,\\times,\\otimes,\\circ)$, two of which ($\\times,\\otimes$) are monoidal closed, and the comonoids for $\\circ$ are precisely categories in the usual sense. We discuss how the various structures in Poly show up in the theory of dynamical systems. We also show that the usual coalgebraic formalism for dynamical systems takes place within Poly. Indeed one can see coalgebras as special dynamical systems---ones that do not record their history---formally analogous to contractible groupoids as special categories.",

These systems should be thought of as ‘machines’ with inputs and outputs, carrying some sort of signal that occurs through some notion of time. Special cases include continuous and discrete dynamical systems (e.g. Moore machines). Additionally, morphisms between the different types of systems allow their translation in a common framework. A central goal is to understand the systems that result from arbitrary interconnection of component subsystems, possibly of different types, as well as establish conditions that ensure totality and determinism compositionally. The fundamental categorical tools used here include lax monoidal functors, which provide a language of compositionality, as well as sheaf theory, which flexibly captures the crucial notion of time.",

We define several pseudo-functorial constructions of modules of systems in the form of doctrines of systems theories.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The analysis and control of stochastic dynamical systems rely on probabilistic models such as (continuous-space) Markov decision processes, but large or continuous state spaces make exact analysis intractable and call for principled quantitative abstraction. This work develops a unified theory of such abstraction by integrating category theory, coalgebra, quantitative logic, and optimal transport, centred on a canonical $\\varepsilon$-quotient of the behavioral pseudo-metric with a universal property: among all abstractions that collapse behavioral differences below $\\varepsilon$, it is the most detailed, and every other abstraction achieving the same discounted value-loss guarantee factors uniquely through it. Categorically, a quotient functor $Q_\\varepsilon$ from a category of probabilistic systems to a category of metric specifications admits, via the Special Adjoint Functor Theorem, a right adjoint $R_\\varepsilon$, yielding an adjunction $Q_\\varepsilon \\dashv R_\\varepsilon$ that formalizes a duality between abstraction and realization; logically, a quantitative modal $\\mu$-calculus with separate reward and transition modalities is shown, for a broad class of systems, to be expressively complete for the behavioral pseudo-metric, with a countable fully abstract fragment suitable for computation. The theory is developed coalgebraically over Polish spaces and the Giry monad and validated on finite-state models using optimal-transport solvers, with experiments corroborating the predicted contraction properties and structural stability and aligning with the theoretical value-loss bounds, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for quantitative state abstraction and representation learning in probabilistic domains.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Risk-reduction behaviors are the first line of defense in viral epidemics. Choosing to not engage in risk-reduction behaviors produced millions of preventable deaths from COVID-19. Understanding why this happens and how to predict it is important for theory development and public policy. We took four approaches to this problem: experimentally varying theory-driven predictors (social rewards, transmission risk, and mandatory/voluntary regulations) in choice scenarios, further probing choices in specific scenarios predicted to elicit risk-taking, conducting hierarchical regressions with demographic and theory-driven predictors for both scenario types, and conducting corresponding regressions for self-reported protective behaviors. The sample consisted of 247 young adults to test highly publicized predictions about how the virus would spread and who would take risks. Results showed that risky choices for scenarios correlated with self-reported behavior and varied with transmission risk and whether regulations were mandatory. Experimentally varying social reward did not elicit greater risk taking as expected by dual-systems theory but risk taking in specific social scenarios was predicted by individual differences in sensation seeking as predicted by dual-systems theory. Sensation seeking predicted social distancing and impulsivity predicted mask wearing. Fuzzy-trace theory's predictors of categorical thinking about risk and endorsement of simple gist principles of social responsibility (to not hurt other people) consistently predicted choices and behaviors, accounting for significant variance beyond dual-systems predictors. Both controlled experiments and real-world self-reported behaviors converged on similar conclusions, identifying a major gap in influential theories (the omission of gist-based thinking) and challenging pessimistic predictions about motivations and mandates in public health.",

    "abstract": "Organizing physics has been a long-standing preoccupation of applied category theory, going back at least to Lawvere. We contribute to this research thread by noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on a consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure -- from the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a compositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a different perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems or open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create any new constraints that must be solved for algebraically. The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric monoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential equations, and a functor between them, functioning as a\"functorial semantics\"for reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for open games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter. We then illustrate our theory by constructing an n-fold pendulum as a composite of n-many pendula.",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) is used to measure cognitive flexibility. In WCST, the participants are required to estimate underlying rules (called \"category\" in WCST) from given sensory signals. Computational modeling of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST is important for elucidating flexible cognitive processing. In this study, we propose a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for explaining the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST, based on the free energy principle (FEP). FEP explains perception and goal-directed action as the minimization of prediction errors between predicted and real sensory signals (called free-energy minimization) and is expected to be an integrated theory of the brain. The primary characteristic of our model is that it considers free energy at future time steps, enabling it to correctly answer WCST as a goal-directed behavior based on the FEP. The simulation experiment showed that the proposed model successfully estimated the underlying categories to be estimated in WCST and correctly answer WCST. This indicates that the proposed model may provide mechanistic insights into flexible cognitive processing from the perspective of FEP.",

Although these two cybernetic theories were developed independently, they overlap in their theoretical foundations and implications and are complementary in their approaches to understanding persons. FEP-AI contributes a potentially valuable formal modeling framework for CB5T, while CB5T provides detail about the science and structure of personality. In this chapter we explore how CB5T and FEP-AI may begin to be integrated into a unified approach to modeling persons.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) are two foundational, principle-based frameworks originally developed to explain brain function. However, since their initial proposals, both frameworks have been generalized to account for the behavior of living systems more broadly. Despite their conceptual overlap and practical successes, a mathematical comparison of the two frameworks has yet to be undertaken. In this article, we briefly introduce and compare the philosophical foundations underlying PCT and FEP. We then introduce and compare their experimental and mathematical foundations concretely in the context of bacterial chemotaxis. With these foundations in place, we can use tools from category theory to argue that PCT can be formally understood as a subset of the FEP framework; however, it is worth noting that the mathematical machinery unique to FEP is not required to successfully model bacterial chemotaxis. Finally, we conclude with a proposal for a mathematical synthesis where each framework plays an orthogonal yet complementary role.",

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "Attempts to establish an absolute single-ion hydration free energy scale have followed multiple strategies. Two central themes consist of (1) employing bulk pair thermodynamic data and an underlying interfacial-potential-free model to partition the hydration free energy into individual contributions [Marcus, Latimer, and tetraphenyl-arsonium/tetraphenyl-borate (TATB) methods] or (2) utilizing bulk thermodynamic and cluster data to estimate the free energy to insert a proton into water, including in principle an interfacial potential contribution [the cluster pair approximation (CPA)]. While the results for the hydration free energy of the proton agree remarkably well between the three approaches in the first category, the value differs from the CPA result by roughly +10 kcal/mol, implying a value for the effective electrochemical surface potential of water of -0.4 V. This paper provides a computational re-analysis of the TATB method for single-ion free energies using quasichemical theory. A previous study indicated a significant discrepancy between the free energies of hydration for the TA cation and the TB anion. We show that the main contribution to this large computed difference is an electrostatic artifact arising from modeling interactions in periodic boundaries. No attempt is made here to develop more accurate models for the local ion/solvent interactions that may lead to further small free energy differences between the TA and TB ions, but the results clarify the primary importance of interfacial potential effects for analysis of the various free energy scales. Results are also presented, related to the TATB assumption in the organic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dichloroethane.",

It is proposed that the global gauge group of such a theory can be identified as the group of automorphisms of the defining functor. Consequently, multiplets of fields may be identified at the functorial level. It is shown that locally covariant theories that obey standard assumptions in Minkowski space, including energy compactness, have no proper endomorphisms (i.e., all endomorphisms are automorphisms) and have a compact automorphism group. Further, it is shown how the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a locally covariant theory may, in principle, be classified in any single spacetime. As an example, the endomorphisms and automorphisms of a system of finitely many free scalar fields are completely classified.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "This paper delves into the application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the concept of the Markov blanket in understanding the neurocognitive implications of concussion. The FEP, a unifying theory in neuroscience, posits that the brain functions to minimize free energy, equating to a reduction in surprise or uncertainty regarding sensory inputs. The Markov blanket, defining the boundary between a system and its environment, is integral to this framework, particularly in understanding how the brain processes and responds to sensory information. We explore how a concussion might disrupt the brain's predictive processing and its ability to minimize free energy, leading to increased prediction errors and cognitive deficits. This disruption is hypothesized to manifest as an inability to accurately predict sensory inputs, resulting in impaired cognitive functions post-concussion. The paper also discusses the potential of neuroplasticity in concussion recovery, framed within the FEP as the brain's effort to re-establish minimized free energy under new constraints. We propose a methodological approach combining neuroimaging and computational modeling to empirically test these hypotheses. This theoretical exploration offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying concussion-induced cognitive impairments and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation strategies.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical approaches. The first aims to make a formal framework for describing self-organizing and life-like systems in general, and the second attempts a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior, the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potential for scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards such a synthesis by expanding on the results of an earlier published evolutionary simulation study, which show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We relate a basic information theoretic measure from the FEP, surprisal, to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ observations is inversely related to the general increase in fitness and integration over evolutionary time. Moreover, surprisal fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures used in IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that it should therefore be possible to relate them to the theoretical concepts used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

However, it faces challenges such as a lack of out-of-distribution generalisation, catastrophic forgetting and poor interpretability. In contrast, biological neural networks, such as those in the human brain, do not suffer from these issues, inspiring AI researchers to explore neuromimetic deep learning, which aims to replicate brain mechanisms within AI models. A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy Principle (FEP) based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle emphasizes that the brain and behavior coordinate with the environment, promoting self-organization. However, it has a theoretical flaw, a possibility of being misunderstood, and a limitation (only likelihood functions are used as constraints). This paper first introduces the semantic information G theory and the R(G) function (where R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). The G theory is based on the P-T probability framework and, therefore, allows for the use of truth, membership, similarity, and distortion functions (related to semantics) as constraints. Based on the study of the R(G) function and logical Bayesian Inference, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R − G = F − H(X|Y) (where F denotes VFE, and H(X|Y) is Shannon conditional entropy) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables; SVB is a reliable and straightforward approach for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, free energy, and VFE in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon information, semantic information, and VFE are analogous to the increment of free energy, the increment of exergy, and physical conditional entropy. The MIE principle builds upon the fundamental ideas of the FEP, making them easier to understand and apply. It needs to combine deep learning methods for wider applications.",

The free-energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised cognitive dynamics of the brain’s higher-order functions. In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.",

    "abstract": "There are realist and antirealist interpretations of the free energy principle (FEP). This paper aims to chart out a structural realist interpretation of FEP. To do so, it draws on Worrall’s (Dialectica 43(1–2): 99–124, 1989) proposal. The general insight of Worrall’s paper is that there is progress at the level of the structure of theories rather than their content. To enact Worrall’s strategy in the context of FEP, this paper will focus on characterising the formal continuity between fundamental equations of thermodynamics—such as Boltzmann’s equation and Gibbs’s equation—on the one hand, and Friston’s characterisation of FEP on the other. Lack of a universal consensus on the physical character of entities that feature in thermodynamics, information theory and FEP notwithstanding, I argue that there is structural continuity and unity at the level of mathematical equations that regiment entropy, information and free energy. The existence of such structural continuity and unity provides grounds for structural realism about FEP.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is currently one of the most promising frameworks with which to address a unified explanation of life-related phenomena. With powerful formalism that embeds a small set of assumptions, it purports to deal with complex adaptive dynamics ranging from barely unicellular organisms to complex cultural manifestations. The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance—in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations—is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account—an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the ‘aboutness’ or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.",

    "title": "An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation",
    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.",

    "abstract": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical frameworks, the first aiming to make a general formal description of self-organization and life-like processes, and the second attempting a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potentially great scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards this synthesis by first partially replicating the results of the evolutionary simulation study by Albantakis et al. (2014) that show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We then relate FEP-related information theoretic measures to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ system states follows the general increase in fitness over evolutionary time, and that it fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures of IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that they therefore should be related to concepts directly used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

    "title": "Models of the Translation Process and the Free Energy Principle",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Translation process research (TPR) has generated a large number of models that aim at explaining human translation processes. In this paper, I suggest an extension of the monitor model to incorporate aspects of relevance theory (RT) and to adopt the free energy principle (FEP) as a generative model to elucidate translational behaviour. The FEP—and its corollary, active inference—provide a general, mathematical framework to explain how organisms resist entropic erosion so as to remain within their phenotypic bounds. It posits that organisms reduce the gap between their expectations and observations by minimising a quantity called free energy. I map these concepts on the translation process and exemplify them with behavioural data. The analysis is based on the notion of translation units (TUs) which exhibit observable traces of the translator’s epistemic and pragmatic engagement with their translation environment, (i.e., the text) that can be measured in terms of translation effort and effects. Sequences of TUs cluster into translation states (steady state, orientation, and hesitation). Drawing on active inference, sequences of translation states combine into translation policies that reduce expected free energy. I show how the notion of free energy is compatible with the concept of relevance, as developed in RT, and how essential concepts of the monitor model and RT can be formalised as deep temporal generative models that can be interpreted under a representationalist view, but also support a non-representationalist account.",

    "title": "A Neural Network Implementation for Free Energy Principle",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.",

The FEP framework is employed to explain the emergence of CTs in the face of cumulative uncertainties and the influence of emotions on belief formation. The FEP account I propose concludes that considering emotional factors, distrust of established authorities, and the social environment, believing in CTs is a bounded rational choice for some individuals in certain contexts. This explains why CT believers are resistant to changing their views. Applying FEP to the complex human behavior of CT belief and propagation, this paper not only provides insights into the phenomenon but also enhances the theoretical credence of FEP itself.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The free energy principle, and its corollary active inference, constitute a bio-inspired theory that assumes biological agents act to remain in a restricted set of preferred states of the world, i.e., they minimize their free energy. Under this principle, biological agents learn a generative model of the world and plan actions in the future that will maintain the agent in an homeostatic state that satisfies its preferences. This framework lends itself to being realized in silico, as it comprehends important aspects that make it computationally affordable, such as variational inference and amortized planning. In this work, we investigate the tool of deep learning to design and realize artificial agents based on active inference, presenting a deep-learning oriented presentation of the free energy principle, surveying works that are relevant in both machine learning and active inference areas, and discussing the design choices that are involved in the implementation process. This manuscript probes newer perspectives for the active inference framework, grounding its theoretical aspects into more pragmatic affairs, offering a practical guide to active inference newcomers and a starting point for deep learning practitioners that would like to investigate implementations of the free energy principle.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Drawing from field theory, Gestalt therapy conceives psychological suffering and psychotherapy as two intentional field phenomena, where unprocessed and chaotic experiences seek the opportunity to emerge and be assimilated through the contact between the patient and the therapist (i.e., the intentionality of contacting). This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.",

    "year": 2003,
    "abstract": "AbstractIn this paper, we show that Goodwillie calculus, as applied to functors from stable homotopy to itself, interacts in striking ways with chromatic aspects of the stable category. Localized at a fixed prime p, let T(n) be the telescope of a vn self map of a finite S–module of type n. The Periodicity Theorem of Hopkins and Smith implies that the Bousfield localization functor associated to T(n)* is independent of choices. Goodwillie’s general theory says that to any homotopy functor F from S–modules to S–modules, there is an associated tower under F, {PdF}, such that F→PdF is the universal arrow to a d–excisive functor. Our first main theorem says that PdF→Pd-1F always admits a homotopy section after localization with respect to T(n)* (and so also after localization with respect to Morava K–theory K(n)*). Thus, after periodic localization, polynomial functors split as the product of their homogeneous factors. This theorem follows from our second main theorem which is equivalent to the following: for any finite group G, the Tate spectrum ${\\mathcal{T}}_{G}(T(n))$\nis weakly contractible. This strengthens and extends previous theorems of Greenlees–Sadofsky, Hovey–Sadofsky, and Mahowald–Shick. The Periodicity Theorem is used in an essential way in our proof. The connection between the two theorems is via a reformulation of a result of McCarthy on dual calculus.",

    "year": 2010,
    "abstract": "There are (at least) two well known constructions of link invariants. One uses skein theory: you resolve each crossing of the link as a linear combination of things that don’t cross, until you eventually get a linear combination of links with no crossings, which you turn into a polynomial. The other uses quantum groups: you construct a functor from a topological category to some category of representations, in such a way that (oriented framed) links get sent to endomorphisms of the trivial representation, which are just rational functions. Certain instances of these two constructions give rise to essentially the same invariants, but when one carefully matches them there is a minus sign that seems out of place. We will discuss exactly how the constructions match up in the case of the Jones polynomial, and where the minus sign comes from.",

    "year": 2014,
    "abstract": "In recent years different aspects of categorification of the boson–fermion correspondence have been studied. In this paper we propose a categorification of the boson–fermion correspondence based on the category of tensor modules of the Lie algebra sl(∞) of finitary infinite matrices. By $${\\mathbb{T}^{+}}$$T+ we denote the category of “polynomial” tensor sl(∞)-modules. There is a natural “creation” functor $${{\\mathcal{T}_{N}} : {\\mathbb{T}^{+}} \\to {\\mathbb{T}^{+}}}$$TN:T+→T+, $${M \\mapsto N \\otimes M, \\quad M,N \\in \\mathbb{T}^{+}}$$M↦N⊗M,M,N∈T+. The key idea of the paper is to employ the entire category $${\\mathbb{T}}$$T of tensor sl(∞)-modules in order to define the “annihilation” functor $${{\\mathcal{D}_{N}} : {\\mathbb{T}^{+}} \\to {\\mathbb{T}^{+}}}$$DN:T+→T+ corresponding to $${{\\mathcal{T}_{N}}}$$TN. We show that the relations allowing one to express fermions via bosons arise from relations in the cohomology of complexes of linear endofunctors on $${{\\mathbb{T}^{+}}}$$T+.",

Coefficients arising from square-zero extensions are used, motivated by work of Turchin and Willwacher in relation to hairy graph cohomology. \nFor the main case of interest, the action of automorphisms of free groups on Hochschild homology factors across outer automorphisms. As the appropriate underlying framework, we introduce and study the category of outer functors, the full subcategory of functors on free groups on which inner automorphisms act trivially. These provide a natural source of coefficient systems for outer automorphisms of free groups. \nThe main results exploit exponential functors, which arise both in calculating higher Hochschild homology and in relation to polynomial functors on free groups. We prove that these are related, using twisting by an orientation module to introduce the necessary Koszul signs. \nWorking over a field of characteristic zero, we then apply the structure theory of polynomial functors to achieve effective calculations of higher Hochschild homology, generalizing the initial results of Turchin and Willwacher. These methods also allow us to prove structure results for outer functors.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "As composites of constant, finite (co)product, identity, and powerset functors, Kripke polynomial functors form a relevant class of $$\\textsf {Set}$$ Set -functors in the theory of coalgebras. The main goal of this paper is to expand the theory of limits in categories of coalgebras of Kripke polynomial functors to the context of quantale-enriched categories. To assume the role of the powerset functor we consider “powerset-like” functors based on the Hausdorff $${\\mathcal {V}}$$ V -category structure. As a starting point, we show that for a lifting of a $$\\textsf {Set}$$ Set -functor to a topological category $$\\textsf {X}$$ X over $$\\textsf {Set}$$ Set that commutes with the forgetful functor, the corresponding category of coalgebras over $$\\textsf {X}$$ X is topological over the category of coalgebras over $$\\textsf {Set}$$ Set and, therefore, it is “as complete” but cannot be “more complete”. Secondly, based on a Cantor-like argument, we observe that Hausdorff functors on categories of quantale-enriched categories do not admit a terminal coalgebra. Finally, in order to overcome these “negative” results, we combine quantale-enriched categories and topology à la Nachbin. Besides studying some basic properties of these categories, we investigate “powerset-like” functors which simultaneously encode the classical Hausdorff metric and Vietoris topology and show that the corresponding categories of coalgebras of “Kripke polynomial” functors are (co)complete.",

A famous result of Noether states that in characteristic zero the maximal degree of a minimal invariant polynomial is bounded above by the order of the group. Our work establishes that the same bound holds for invariant skew polynomials in the exterior algebra. Our approach to the problem relies on a theorem of Derksen that connects invariant theory to the study of ideals of subspace arrangements. We adapt his proof over the polynomial ring to the exterior algebra, reducing the question to establishing a bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of intersections of linear ideals in the exterior algebra. We prove the required regularity bound using tools from representation theory. In particular, the proof relies on the existence of a functor on the category of polynomial functors that translates resolutions of ideals of subspace arrangements over the polynomial ring to resolutions of ideals of subspace arrangements over the exterior algebra.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Abstract Let (correspondingly ) denote the abelian category of functors (strict polynomial functors in the sense of Friedlander and Suslin) from finite dimensional vector spaces over Fp to vector spaces over Fp . These two categories are related via the exact forgetful functor The category is strongly related to topology and representation theory of symmetric and general linear groups but the homological algebra in is rather mysterious. The category is easier for cohomological calculations. The known calculations are obtained only for functors which belong to the image of ι and are performed using comparison of - and -groups induced by ι. The aim of the following note is to find cohomological conditions which guarantee that a given functor comes from via ι.",

    "title": "Robustly Parameterised Higher-Order Probabilistic Models",
    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "We present a method for constructing robustly parameterised families of higher-order probabilistic models. Parameter spaces and models are represented by certain classes of functors in the category of Polish spaces. Maps from parameter spaces to models (parameterisations) are continuous and natural transformations between such functors. Naturality ensures that parameterised models are invariant by change of granularity -- ie that parameterisations are intrinsic. Continuity ensures that models are robust with respect to their parameterisation. Our method allows one to build models from a set of basic functors among which the Giry probabilistic functor, spaces of cadlag trajectories (in continuous and discrete time), multisets and compact powersets. These functors can be combined by guarded composition, product and coproduct. Parameter spaces range over the polynomial closure of Giry-like functors. Thus we obtain a class of robust parameterised models which includes the Dirichlet process, various point processes (random sequences with values in Polish spaces) and other classical objects of probability theory. By extending techniques developed in prior work, we show how to reduce the questions of existence, uniqueness, naturality, and continuity of a parameterised model to combinatorial questions only involving finite spaces.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Category theory is unmatched in its ability to organize and layer abstractions and to find commonalities between structures of all sorts. No longer the exclusive preserve of pure mathematicians, it is now proving itself to be a powerful tool in science, informatics, and industry. By facilitating communication between communities and building rigorous bridges between disparate worlds, applied category theory has the potential to be a major organizing force. This book offers a self-contained tour of applied category theory. Each chapter follows a single thread motivated by a real-world application and discussed with category-theoretic tools. We see data migration as an adjoint functor, electrical circuits in terms of monoidal categories and operads, and collaborative design via enriched profunctors. All the relevant category theory, from simple to sophisticated, is introduced in an accessible way with many examples and exercises, making this an ideal guide even for those without experience of university-level mathematics.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Clustering and switching are hypothesised to reflect the automatic and controlled components in category fluency, respectively, but how they are associated with cognitive functions has not been fully elucidated, due to several uncertainties. (1) The conventional scoring method that segregates responses by semantic categories could not optimally dissociate the automatic and controlled components. (2) The temporal structure of individual responses, as characterised by mean retrieval time (MRT) and mean switching time (MST), has seldom been analysed alongside the more well-studied variables, cluster size (CS) and number of switches (NS). (3) Most studies examined only one to a few semantic categories, raising concerns of generalisability. This study built upon a distance-based automatic clustering procedure, referred to as temporal–semantic distance procedure, to thoroughly characterise the category fluency performance. Linear mixed-effects (LME) modelling was applied to re-examine the differential associations of clustering and switching with cognitive functions with a sample of 80 university students. Our results revealed that although lexical retrieval speed (LRS) is clearly the determining factor for effective clustering and switching, matrix reasoning and processing speed also have significant roles to play, possibly in the processes of identifying and validating the semantic relationships. Interestingly, total fluency score was accurately predicted by the four clustering/switching indices alone; including the cognitive variables did not significantly improve the prediction. These findings underline the importance of the clustering and switching indices in explaining the category fluency performance and the cognitive demands in category fluency.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarize essential biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical aspects in the field of topically applied medicines that may help scientists when trying to develop new topical medicines. After a brief history of topical drug delivery, a review of the structure and function of the skin and routes of drug absorption and their limitations is provided. The most prevalent diseases and current topical treatment approaches are then detailed, the organization of which reflects the key disease categories of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, microbial infections, skin cancers, and genetic skin diseases. The complexity of topical product development through to large-scale manufacturing along with recommended risk mitigation approaches are then highlighted. As such topical treatments are applied externally, patient preferences along with the challenges they invoke are then described, and finally the future of this field of drug delivery is discussed, with an emphasis on areas that are more likely to yield significant improvements over the topical medicines in current use or would expand the range of medicines and diseases treatable by this route of administration. Significance Statement This review of the key aspects of the skin and its associated diseases and current treatments along with the intricacies of topical formulation development should be helpful in making judicious decisions about the development of new or improved topical medicines. These aspects include the choices of the active ingredients, formulations, the target patient population’s preferences, limitations, and the future with regard to new skin diseases and topical medicine approaches.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "BackgroundPrognostic scoring systems are used to estimate the risk of mortality from metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Outcomes from different therapies may vary within each risk group. These survival algorithms have been applied to assess outcomes in patients receiving T-cell checkpoint inhibitory immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, but have not been applied extensively to patients receiving high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) immunotherapy.MethodsSurvival of 810 mRCC patients treated from 2006 to 2017 with high dose IL-2 (aldesleukin) and enrolled in the PROCLAIMSM registry data base was assessed utilizing the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk criteria. Median follow-up is 23.4 months (mo.) (range 0.2–124 mo.). Subgroup evaluations were performed by separating patients by prior or no prior therapy, IL-2 alone, or therapy subsequent to IL-2. Some patients were in two groups. We will focus on the 356 patients who received IL-2 alone, and evaluate outcome by risk factor categories.ResultsAmong the 810 patients, 721 were treatment-naïve (89%) and 59% were intermediate risk. Overall, of the 249 patients with favorable risk, the median overall survival (OS) is 63.3 mo. and the 2-year OS is 77.6%. Of 480 patients with intermediate risk, median OS is 42.4 mo., 2-year OS 68.2%, and of 81 patients with poor risk, median OS 14 mo., 2-year OS 40.4%. Among those who received IL-2 alone (356 patients), median OS is 64.5, 57.6, and 14 months for favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories respectively. Two year survival among those treated only with HD IL-2 is 73.4, 63.7 and 39.8%, for favorable, intermediate and poor risk categories respectively.ConclusionsAmong mRCC patients treated with HD IL-2, all risk groups have median and 2-year survival consistent with recent reports of checkpoint or targeted therapies for mRCC. Favorable and intermediate risk (by IMDC) patients treated with HD IL-2 have longer OS compared with poor risk patients, with most durable OS observed in favorable risk patients. Favorable risk patients treated with HD IL-2 alone have a 2-year OS of 74%. These data continue to support a recommendation for HD IL-2 for patients with mRCC who meet eligibility criteria.Trial registrationPROCLAIM, NCT01415167 was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on August 11, 2011, and initiated for retrospective data collection until 2006, and prospective data collection ongoing since 2011.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) is essential for discerning human emotions and is applied extensively in big data analytics, healthcare, security, and user experience enhancement. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art deep learning models—VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet, GoogLeNet V1, MobileNet V1, EfficientNet V2, ShuffleNet V2, and RepVGG—on the task of facial expression recognition using the FER2013 dataset. Key performance metrics, including test accuracy, training time, and weight file size, were analyzed to assess the learning efficiency, generalization capabilities, and architectural innovations of each model. EfficientNet V2 and ResNet50 emerged as top performers, achieving high accuracy and stable convergence using compound scaling and residual connections, enabling them to capture complex emotional features with minimal overfitting. DenseNet, GoogLeNet V1, and RepVGG also demonstrated strong performance, leveraging dense connectivity, inception modules, and re-parameterization techniques, though they exhibited slower initial convergence. In contrast, lightweight models such as MobileNet V1 and ShuffleNet V2, while excelling in computational efficiency, faced limitations in accuracy, particularly in challenging emotion categories like “fear” and “disgust”. The results highlight the critical trade-offs between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate architecture based on application-specific requirements. This research contributes to ongoing advancements in deep learning, particularly in domains such as facial expression recognition, where capturing subtle and complex patterns is essential for high-performance outcomes.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This study introduces a deep learning (DL) framework designed to classify YouTube videos into five exercise categories: TABATA, cardiorespiratory endurance, free weight muscular endurance, training aid muscular endurance, and flexibility. These categories were identified by two domain experts in sports science based on video content, tags, and user interaction patterns. Utilizing data from 1284 Traditional Chinese-language YouTube videos and 39,141 comments posted between March 2023 and June 2024, we applied text preparation techniques and sentiment analysis to clean and analyze the dataset. The study incorporated five key features—titles, hashtags, descriptions, comments, and sentiment, and employed Word2Vec with the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model for word embedding, effectively handling short YouTube comments. We evaluated several predictive models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST), Text Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM, and BERT, using 10-fold cross-validation and comparing their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The results indicate that BERT outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of 92.25% (based on 10-fold cross-validation) when all five features were used. Incorporating sentiment analysis enhanced prediction performance across all models, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.85%. Ablation analysis confirmed the significant role of sentiment in improving prediction outcomes. Furthermore, a paired samples t-test revealed statistically significant differences in performance metrics when sentiment was included as a feature. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining deep learning and sentiment analysis to predict home-based exercise video categories on YouTube, offering valuable insights into content trends and user engagement in the evolving digital fitness landscape.",

    "title": "Causal models in string diagrams",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The framework of causal models provides a principled approach to causal reasoning, applied today across many scientific domains. Here we present this framework in the language of string diagrams, interpreted formally using category theory. A class of string diagrams, called network diagrams, are in 1-to-1 correspondence with directed acyclic graphs. A causal model is given by such a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions, or general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard' structure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that can be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by Fong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we present diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models in a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal models, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including but beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal model with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a normalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully diagrammatically. We define counterfactuals in this setup, and treat the problems of the identifiability of causal effects and counterfactuals fully diagrammatically. The benefits of such a presentation of causal models lie in foundational questions in causal reasoning and in their clarificatory role and pedagogical value. This work aims to be accessible to different communities, from causal model practitioners to researchers in applied category theory, and discusses many examples from the literature for illustration. Overall, we argue and demonstrate that causal reasoning according to the causal model framework is most naturally and intuitively done as diagrammatic reasoning.",

It does this by taking examples $(a, f(a))\\in A\\times B$, and updating the parameter according to some rule. We define a category where these update rules may be composed, and show that gradient descent-with respect to a fixed step size and an error function satisfying a certain property-defines a monoidal functor from a category of parametrised functions to this category of update rules. A key contribution is the notion of request function. This provides a structural perspective on backpropagation, giving a broad generalisation of neural networks and linking it with structures from bidirectional programming and open games.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The replicability of sports and exercise research has not been assessed previously despite concerns about scientific practices within the field. This study aims to provide an initial estimate of the replicability of applied sports and exercise science research published in quartile 1 journals (SCImago journal ranking for 2019 in the Sports Science subject category; www.scimagojr.com) between 2016 and 2021. A formalised selection protocol for this replication project was previously published. Voluntary collaborators were recruited, and studies were allocated in a stratified and randomised manner on the basis of equipment and expertise. Original authors were contacted to provide deidentified raw data, to review preregistrations and to provide methodological clarifications. A multiple inferential strategy was employed to analyse the replication data. The same analysis (i.e. F test or t test) was used to determine whether the replication effect size was statistically significant and in the same direction as the original effect size. Z-tests were used to determine whether the original and replication effect size estimates were compatible or significantly different in magnitude. In total, 25 replication studies were included for analysis. Of the 25, 10 replications used paired t tests, 1 used an independent t test and 14 used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the statistical analyses. In all, 7 (28%) studies demonstrated robust replicability, meeting all three validation criteria: achieving statistical significance (p < 0.05) in the same direction as the original study and showing compatible effect size magnitudes as per the Z test (p > 0.05). There was a substantial decrease in the published effect size estimate magnitudes when replicated; therefore, sports and exercise science researchers should consider effect size uncertainty when conducting subsequent power analyses. Additionally, there were many barriers to conducting the replication studies, e.g., original author communication and poor data and reporting transparency.",

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "Herein we develop category-theoretic tools for understanding network-style diagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is that of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov processes, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key feature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with multiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that may then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network. The components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in this language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by introducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic languages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic interpretation gives a hypergraph functor. The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories. In particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations. Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are modelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components themselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through decorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that permits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors. These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these principles, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear time-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "Passive linear networks are used in a wide variety of engineering applications, but the best studied are electrical circuits made of resistors, inductors and capacitors. We describe a category where a morphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output terminals. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the ‘black box functor’, that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. We prove that this functor is a symmetric monoidal dagger functor between dagger compact categories. We assume the reader has some familiarity with category theory, but none with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.",

    "title": "Causal Theories: A Categorical Perspective on Bayesian Networks",
    "year": 2013,
    "abstract": "In this dissertation we develop a new formal graphical framework for causal reasoning. Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. \nERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in $V$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category.

    "abstract": "2024 8th International Conference on Data Mining, Communications and Information Technology (DMCIT 2024), was successfully held on May 25, 2024, which was organized by Asia Pacific Institute of Science and Engineering (APISE), media supported by Internet of Things Technologies, Modern Electronics Technique, Journal of Xidian University, Journal of Information and Intelligence, OPTICAL COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, Telecommunication Engineering. The conference was held in Hong Kong from May 24-26, 2024 as planned. Considering that some participants could not attend in person, the conference was adjusted as a hybrid conference, as a combination of on-line and off-line conference. The proceedings of this year’s edition comprised three main categories: “1. Advanced Methods and Algorithms”; “2. Applied Technologies in Various Domains”; “3. Case Studies and Practical Implementations”. All these submissions were rigorously reviewed by the Program Committee. The conference attracted 45 submissions in total, and out of 27 papers were accepted, including countries like Canada, France, China, India, New Zealand, Spain, Thailand, etc. On the conference day, 8 oral presentations and 18 poster presentations were arranged according to the participants’ choices. Each presenter was given 15 minutes to deliver their presentation, including 3 minutes Q&A. Two awards, one best oral presentation award and one best poster presentation award were selected by the end of the conference. The conference was inaugurated with the esteemed Dr. Simon Fong from the University of Macau, Macau S.A.R., China, and Dr. Ka-Chun Wong from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.A.R., China, both delivering outstanding opening remarks. The conference was honored by the presence of four eminent keynote speakers who graced the event with their distinguished speeches.

In particular, classicality is witnessed by 'spiders' which fuse together whenever they connect. We define mixedness and show that pure processes are extremal in the space of all processes, and we define entanglement and show that quantum theory indeed exhibits entanglement. We discuss the classification of tripartite qubit entanglement and show that both the GHZ-state and the W-state come from spider-like families of processes, which differ only in how they behave when they are connected by two or more wires. We define measurements and provide fully-comprehensive descriptions of several quantum protocols involving classical data flow. Finally, we give a notion of 'genuine quantumness', from which special processes called 'phase spiders' arise, and get a first glimpse of quantum non-locality.",

    "title": "Open System Categorical Quantum Semantics in Natural Language Processing",
    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "Originally inspired by categorical quantum mechanics (Abramsky and Coecke, LiCS'04), the categorical compositional distributional model of natural language meaning of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure within a Lambek pregroup and a vectorial representation of the meaning of its parts. The predictions of this first model have outperformed that of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large scale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret word meaning. \nIn this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data. This experiment moreover provides preliminary evidence of the validity of our proposed new model for word meaning. \nSecondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative counterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding relative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm, enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity.",

    "title": "Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music, to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner. Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition, but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation. All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different genres and directions.",

    "title": "A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Musical Intelligence",
    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music, in particular for musical composition and access to large databases for commercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system.",

    "title": "Categorical Semantics for Time Travel",
    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "We introduce a general categorical framework to reason about quantum theory and other process theories living in spacetimes where chronology violation can occur-e.g. in the form of Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs)-allowing resources to travel back in time and provide computational speedups. Our framework is based on a weakening of the definition of traced symmetric monoidal categories, obtained by dropping the yanking axiom and the requirement that the trace be defined on all morphisms. We show that the two leading models for quantum theory with closed timelike curves-namely the P-CTC model of Lloyd et al. and the D-CTC model of Deutsch-are captured by our framework, and in doing so we provide the first compositional description of the D-CTC model. Our description of the D-CTC model results in a process theory which respects the constraints of relativistic causality: this is in direct contrast to the P-CTC model, where CTCs are implemented by a trace and allow post-selection to be performed deterministically.",

    "year": 2009,
    "abstract": "In recent work, symmetric dagger-monoidal (SDM) categories have emerged as a convenient categorical formalization of quantum mechanics. The objects represent physical systems, the morphisms physical operations, whereas the tensors describe composite systems. Classical data turn out to correspond to Frobenius algebras with some additional properties. They express the distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data, classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts the paradigm of ”quantization” of a classical theory to ”classicization” of a quantum theory. Remarkably, the simple SDM framework suffices not only for this conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical operations (i.e. functions) from the nondeterministic classical operations (i.e. relations), and the probabilistic classical operations (stochastic maps). Moreover, a combination of some basic categorical constructions (due to Kleisli, resp. Grothendieck) with the categorical presentations of quantum states, provides a resource sensitive account of various quantum-classical interactions: of classical control of quantum data, of classical data arising from quantum measurements, as well as of the classical data processing inbetween controls and measurements. A salient feature here is the graphical calculus for categorical quantum mechanics, which allows a purely diagrammatic representation of classical-quantum interaction.",

The basis is normalised exactly when the corresponding commutative †-Frobenius monoid is special. Hence, both orthogonal and orthonormal bases are characterised without mentioning vectors, but just in terms of the categorical structure: composition of operations, tensor product and the †-functor. Moreover, this characterisation can be interpreted operationally, since the †-Frobenius structure allows the cloning and deletion of basis vectors. That is, we capture the basis vectors by relying on their ability to be cloned and deleted. Since this ability distinguishes classical data from quantum data, our result has important implications for categorical quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Compositionality is at the heart of computer science and several other areas of applied category theory such as computational linguistics, categorical quantum mechanics, interpretable AI, dynamical systems, compositional game theory, and Petri nets. However, the meaning of the term seems to vary across the many different applications. This work contributes to understanding, and in particular qualifying, different kinds of compositionality. Formally, we introduce invariants of categories that we call zeroth and first homotopy posets, generalising in a precise sense the pi0 and pi1 of a groupoid. These posets can be used to obtain a qualitative description of how far an object is from being terminal and a morphism is from being iso. In the context of applied category theory, this formal machinery gives us a way to qualitatively describe the\"failures of compositionality\", seen as failures of certain (op)lax functors to be strong, by classifying obstructions to the (op)laxators being isomorphisms. Failure of compositionality, for example for the interpretation of a categorical syntax in a semantic universe, can both be a bad thing and a good thing, which we illustrate by respective examples in graph theory and quantum theory.",

    "abstract": "There are different meanings of the term\"compositionality\"within science: what one researcher would call compositional, is not at all compositional for another researcher. The most established conception is usually attributed to Frege, and is characterised by a bottom-up flow of meanings: the meaning of the whole can be derived from the meanings of the parts, and how these parts are structured together. Inspired by work on compositionality in quantum theory, and categorical quantum mechanics in particular, we propose the notions of Schrodinger, Whitehead, and complete compositionality. Accounting for recent important developments in quantum technology and artificial intelligence, these do not have the bottom-up meaning flow as part of their definitions. Schrodinger compositionality accommodates quantum theory, and also meaning-as-context. Complete compositionality further strengthens Schrodinger compositionality in order to single out theories like ZX-calculus, that are complete with regard to the intended model. All together, our new notions aim to capture the fact that compositionality is at its best when it is `real', `non-trivial', and even more when it also is `complete'. At this point we only put forward the intuitive and/or restricted formal definitions, and leave a fully comprehensive definition to future collaborative work.",

    "abstract": "A symmetric monoidal category naturally arises as the mathematical structure that organizes physical systems, processes, and composition thereof, both sequentially and in parallel. This structure admits a purely graphical calculus. This paper is concerned with the encoding of a fixed causal structure within a symmetric monoidal category: causal dependencies will correspond to topological connectedness in the graphical language. We show that correlations, either classical or quantum, force terminality of the tensor unit. We also show that well-definedness of the concept of a global state forces the monoidal product to be only partially defined, which in turn results in a relativistic covariance theorem. Except for these assumptions, at no stage do we assume anything more than purely compositional symmetric-monoidal categorical structure. We cast these two structural results in terms of a mathematical entity, which we call a causal category. We provide methods of constructing causal categories, and we study the consequences of these methods for the general framework of categorical quantum mechanics.",

This paper contributes to the project by expanding the model to also capture entailment relations. This is achieved by extending the representations of words from points in meaning space to density operators, which are probability distributions on the subspaces of the space. A symmetric measure of similarity and an asymmetric measure of entailment is defined, where lexical entailment is measured using von Neumann entropy, the quantum variant of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Lexical entailment, combined with the composition map on word representations, provides a method to obtain entailment relations on the level of sentences.

It is a subcategory MSpek of the category of finite sets, relations and the cartesian product. States of maximal knowledge form a subcategory Spek. This establishes the consistency of the toy theory, which has previously only been constructed for at most four systems. Our model also shows that the theory is closed under both parallel and sequential composition of operations (= symmetric monoidal structure), that it obeys map-state duality (= compact closure), and that states and effects are in bijective correspondence (= dagger structure). From the perspective of categorical quantum mechanics, this provides an interesting alternative model which enables us to describe many quantum phenomena in a discrete manner, and to which mathematical concepts such as basis structures, and complementarity thereof, still apply. Hence, the framework of categorical quantum mechanics has delivered on its promise to encompass theories other than quantum theory.",

In this paper we consider the conceptual foundations for this canvas, and how these can then be converted into mathematical structure.

It also provides new insights both in quantum foundations and in quantum information, and has even resulted in automated reasoning software called `quantomatic' which exploits the deductive power of CQM. In this paper we complement the available material by not requiring prior knowledge of category theory, and by pointing at connections to previous and current developments in the foundations of physics. This research program is also in close synergy with developments elsewhere, for example in representation theory, quantum algebra, knot theory, topological quantum field theory and several other areas.",

    "abstract": "The ability to compose parts to form a more complex whole, and to analyze a whole as a combination of elements, is desirable across disciplines. This workshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to physics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing aim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within the framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in vector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by quantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in vector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space models in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988] utilise notions of distance between feature vectors. More recently Gardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model of concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and information is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously [Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game theory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object, compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games from smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the interaction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical compositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018]. Moreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science, linguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in cognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game theoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [Jager, 2008]. Lastly, the study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined [Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007]. Physics supplies compositional approaches via vector spaces and categorical quantum theory, allowing the interplay between the three disciplines to be examined.",

The seven components of the Tree – the sephiroths – reflect the seven psychological characteristic features of the human being which it is necessary to develop and perfect, harmonizing them with both each other and with the outer world.

    "title": "Differential Operators on Sketches via Alpha Contours",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "A vector sketch is a popular and natural geometry representation depicting a 2D shape. When viewed from afar, the disconnected vector strokes of a sketch and the empty space around them visually merge into positive space and negative space, respectively. Positive and negative spaces are the key elements in the composition of a sketch and define what we perceive as the shape. Nevertheless, the notion of positive or negative space is mathematically ambiguous: While the strokes unambiguously indicate the interior or boundary of a 2D shape, the empty space may or may not belong to the shape's exterior. For standard discrete geometry representations, such as meshes or point clouds, some of the most robust pipelines rely on discretizations of differential operators, such as Laplace-Beltrami. Such discretizations are not available for vector sketches; defining them may enable numerous applications of classical methods on vector sketches. However, to do so, one needs to define the positive space of a vector sketch, or the sketch shape. Even though extracting this 2D sketch shape is mathematically ambiguous, we propose a robust algorithm, Alpha Contours, constructing its conservative estimate: a 2D shape containing all the input strokes, which lie in its interior or on its boundary, and aligning tightly to a sketch. This allows us to define popular differential operators on vector sketches, such as Laplacian and Steklov operators. We demonstrate that our construction enables robust tools for vector sketches, such as As-Rigid-As-Possible sketch deformation and functional maps between sketches, as well as solving partial differential equations on a vector sketch.",

    "title": "Seven white dwarfs with circumstellar gas discs II: Tracing the composition of exoplanetary building blocks",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "\n This second paper presents an in-depth analysis of the composition of the planetary material that has been accreted onto seven white dwarfs with circumstellar dust and gas emission discs with abundances reported in Paper I. The white dwarfs are accreting planetary bodies with a wide range of oxygen, carbon, and sulfur volatile contents, including one white dwarf that shows the most enhanced sulfur abundance seen to date. Three white dwarfs show tentative evidence (2–3 σ) of accreting oxygen-rich material, potentially from water-rich bodies, whilst two others are accreting dry, rocky material. One white dwarf is accreting a mantle-rich fragment of a larger differentiated body, whilst two white dwarfs show an enhancement in their iron abundance and could be accreting core-rich fragments. Whilst most planetary material accreted by white dwarfs display chondritic or bulk Earth-like compositions, these observations demonstrate that core-mantle differentiation, disruptive collisions, and the accretion of core-mantle differentiated material are important. Less than one percent of polluted white dwarfs host both observable circumstellar gas and dust. It is unknown whether these systems are experiencing an early phase in the disruption and accretion of planetary bodies, or alternatively if they are accreting larger planetary bodies. From this work there is no substantial evidence for significant differences in the accreted refractory abundance ratios for those white dwarfs with or without circumstellar gas, but there is tentative evidence for those with circumstellar gas discs to be accreting more water rich material which may suggest that volatiles accrete earlier in a gas-rich phase.",

    "title": "Comparison of Morphometric Parameters, Nutritional Composition, and Textural Properties of Seven Crustaceans Species",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "In order to study the muscle quality of different crustaceans, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of their muscle quality characteristics as a theoretical reference. In this work, seven major species of farmed and consumer crustaceans were selected, including crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii), pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), kuruma prawns (Penaeus japonicus), river prawns (Macrobranchium nipponense), and Chinese shrimp (Penaeus chinensis). Their morphometric parameters, nutritional composition, textural properties, and physical and chemical indexes were comparatively analyzed. The results showed that the meat content (MC, about 14.78%) of crayfish was significantly lower than that of the other six species. By contrast, pacific white shrimp had the highest MC, although the MCs of black tiger shrimp, kuruma prawns, and Chinese shrimp are greater than 40%. All seven crustacean species were high in protein and low in fat, while pacific white shrimp had the highest crude protein, crude lipid, and crude ash content compared to the other crustaceans. The content of threonine (Thr) was the highest in crayfish. The content of methionine (Met) and lysine (Lys) was the highest in freshwater prawns. The content of isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), and non–essential amino acid (NEAA) was the highest in pacific white shrimp. C18:2n-6 (linoleic acid, LA) was the highest in freshwater prawns and pacific white shrimp; C18:3n-3 (linolenic acid, LNA), C20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, AA), unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were all the highest in crayfish; and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was the highest in freshwater prawns, but the content was not significantly different from crayfish, pacific white shrimp, black tiger shrimp, and Chinese shrimp. Pacific white shrimp had the highest values for hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness. The redness values of crayfish, black tiger shrimp, and Chinese shrimp were significantly higher than those of the other three species except kuruma prawns. Compared to other crustaceans, river prawns had the highest drip loss and cooking loss. Black tiger shrimp and Chinese shrimp had the lowest cooking loss rates. The research shows that the tail muscle of the seven species of crustaceans is rich in protein, essential amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids and low in fat, representing a high-quality protein. Among these crustaceans, the main essential amino acids and essential fatty acids in the tail muscle of pacific white shrimp, freshwater prawns, and crayfish are higher in content and better in nutritional value.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "This study is based on the fatty acid and amino acid profiles of seven edible insect species: Acheta domesticus, Alphitobius diaperinus, Blaptica dubia, Galleria mellonella, Locusta migratoria, Tenebrio molitor, and Zophobas morio. The aim of the present study is to provide new data on the fatty acid distributions among lipid classes as well as the species-specific protein conversion factor (Kp) of a wide range of insects in order to further improve the nutritional characterisation of insects as food. Oleic acid was the predominant fatty acid in all insects except for A. domesticus, in which a significantly higher percentage of linoleic acid was found. The majority of the lipids were neutral lipids. A significant amount of α-linolenic acid in the phospholipid fraction of L. migratoria was shown, while in T. molitor, phospholipids were the only fraction in which a measurable amount of docosahexaenoic acid was found. Overall, in most insects, the phospholipid fraction had the highest polyunsaturated fatty acid content compared to the other classes, which may be protective in terms of auto-oxidative stability. Kp values in the range of 4.17 to 6.43 were obtained. Within the nutritional quality indices, all insects showed healthy fatty acids and high-quality amino acid profiles.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Hypericum species and especially H. perforatum L. are well known for their therapeutic applications. The present study assessed the essential oil (EO) composition, and antifungal and aphid suppression activity of seven Bulgarian Hypericum species. The EOs were analyzed by GC–MS–FID. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, H. perforatum, H. maculatum, and H. hirsutum were used. Additionally, the EO composition of H. perforatum extracted via hydrodistillation (ClevA) and via commercial steam distillation (Com) were compared. The second experiment compared the EOs of H. perforatum, H. cerastoides, H. rumeliacum, H. montbretii, and H. calycinum (flowers and leaves) extracted via hydrodistillation and collected with n-hexane. Overall, the EO constituents belonged to four classes, namely alkanes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and fatty acids. The main class for compounds in H. maculatum and H. perforatum (section Hypericum) were sesquiterpenes for both experiments except for H. perforatum (Com). Hypericum montbretii (section Drosocarpium) EO had monoterpenes (38.09%) and sesquiterpenes (37.09%) as major groups, while H. hirsutum EO (section Taeniocarpium) contained predominately alkanes (67.19%). Hypericum hirsutum EO contained cedrol (5.04%), found for the first time in Hypericum species. Fatty acids were the main compounds in H. cerastoides (section Campylopus), while monoterpenes were the most abundant class in H. rumeliacum and H. calycinum EOs. α-Pinene and germacrene D were the major EO constituents of all analyzed Hypericum species except for H. hirsutum and H. cerastoides. Hypericum perforatum EO (Com) had significant repellent and insecticidal activity against two aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi (Bird Cherry-oat aphid) and Sitobion avenae (English grain aphid) at concentrations of 0%, 1%, 2.5%, 3.5%, 4.5%, and 5%. The tested EOs did not show significant activity against selected economically important agricultural fungal pathogens Fusarium spp., Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum spp., Rhizoctonia solani, and Aspergillus sp. The EO of the Hypericum species found in the Bulgarian flora could be utilized for the development of new biopesticides for aphid control.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Human aging is characterized by gut microbiome alteration and differential loss of gut commensal species associated with the onset of frailty. The administration of cultured commensal strains to replenish lost taxa could potentially promote healthy aging. To investigate the interaction of whole microbiomes and administered strains, we transplanted gut microbiota from a frail or healthy elderly subject into germ-free mice. We supplemented the frail-donor recipient group with a defined consortium of taxa (the “S7”) that we identified by analyzing healthy aging subjects in our previous studies and whose abundance correlated with health-promoting dietary intervention. Inoculation with a frail or a healthy donor microbiome resulted in differential microbiota compositions in murine recipients 5 weeks post-transplantation. Fecal acetate levels were significantly higher in healthy donor recipient mice than in frail donor recipient mice after 4 weeks. However, the frailty-related phenotype was not replicated in recipient mice with single-dose microbiota transplantation from a healthy and a frail donor. Five S7 species colonized successfully in germ-free mice, with a relatively high abundance of Barnesiella intestinihominis and Eubacterium rectale. The engraftment of five S7 species in germ-free mice increased fecal acetate levels and reduced colon permeability and plasma TNF-ɑ concentration. Supplementation with the S7 in frail-microbiota recipient mice did not increase alpha-diversity but significantly increased the abundance of Barnesiella intestinihominis. S7 supplementation showed the potential for improving spatial reference memory in frail-microbiota recipient mice. Collectively, these data highlight the challenge of elderly microbiota engraftment in the germ-free mouse model but show promise for modulating the gut microbiome of frail elderly subjects by administering an artificial gut microbe consortium associated with healthy aging.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In this work, seven Citrus aurantium essential oils (EOs) derived from flavedo of cultivars ‘Canaliculata’, ‘Consolei’, ‘Crispifolia’, ‘Fasciata’, ‘Foetifera’, ‘Listata’, and ‘Bizzaria’ were investigated. EOs were also combined in 1:1 (v/v) ratio to identify possible synergism or antagonism of actions. GC-MS analysis was done to investigate Eos’ phytochemical profiles. The antioxidant activity was studied by using a multi-target approach based on FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, and β-carotene bleaching tests. A great difference was observed in EOs’ phytochemical profiles. d-limonene (33.35–89.17%) was the main monoterpene hydrocarbon, and α-Pinene, β-myrcene, and β-linalool were identified in almost all samples. Among EOs, only C3 showed high quantitative and qualitative variability in its chemical composition. The chemical diversity of EOs was also demonstrated by PCA and HCA statistical analysis. Samples C2, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were statistically similar to each other, while C1 and C3 were characterized as having a different amount of other compounds and oxygenated monoterpenes, respectively, with respect to the other EOs mentioned. The global antioxidant score (GAS) revealed that among the tested EOs, C. aurantium ‘Fasciata’ EO had the highest antioxidant potential, with a GAS value of −0.47, whereas among combinations, the EO obtained by mixing ‘Canaliculata’ + ‘Bizzaria’ was the most active. Comparison by theoretical and real data on inhibitory concentration (IC50) and FRAP values did not reveal any significant effect of synergism or antagonism of actions to be valid in all biological applied tests. These findings, considered together, represent an important starting point to understand which compounds are responsible for the activities and their future possible industrial application.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Peaches are tasty and juicy, with a unique flavor. The flavors of peaches always vary with cultivars. To investigate the physicochemical and aroma characteristics of peaches, the sugars, organic acids, total flavonoids, phenols, antioxidant activities, and aroma compounds of seven peach cultivars in Xinjiang were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS). The results showed that sucrose (59.83 to 87.34%), malic acid (32.41 to 59.14%), and chlorogenic acid (10.43 to 45.50%) were the dominant sugar, organic acid, and phenolic compound in peaches, respectively. The antioxidant activity varied between 147.81 and 394.55 μmol TEs/100 g. The analysis of the aroma structure of peaches found that the volatile composition of peaches was relatively consistent, though the concentration of total aroma and certain separate compounds were different between cultivars. Meanwhile, the aroma fingerprint of the peaches consisted of hexyl acetate, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, γ-decalactone, n-hexanal, 2-hexenal, nonanal, decanal benzaldehyde and 6-pentylpyran-2-one, providing a clear green, sweet, floral, and fruity odor. These results provide complete information on the physicochemical properties, functional ingredients and aroma of the peaches.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Semantic compositionality—the way that meanings of complex entities obtain from meanings of constituent entities and their structural relations—is supposed to explain certain concomitant cognitive capacities, such as systematicity. Yet, cognitive scientists are divided on mechanisms for compositionality: e.g. a language of thought on one side versus a geometry of thought on the other. Category theory is a field of (meta)mathematics invented to bridge formal divides. We focus on sheaving—a construction at the nexus of algebra and geometry/topology, alluding to an integrative view, to sketch out a category theory perspective on the semantics of compositionality. Sheaving is a universal construction for making inferences from local knowledge, where meaning is grounded by the underlying topological space. Three examples illustrate how topology conveys meaning, in terms of the inclusion relations between the open sets that constitute the space, though the topology is not regarded as the only source of semantic information. In this sense, category (sheaf) theory provides a general framework for semantic compositionality. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition’.",

This allows us to devise an extension, and its semantics, of the ZX-calculus with probabilistic choices by freely enriching over convex algebras, which are the algebras of the finite distribution monad.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Monads provide a simple and concise interface to user-defined computational effects in functional programming languages. This enables equational reasoning about effects, abstraction over monadic interfaces and the development of monad transformer stacks to combine different effects. Compiler implementors and assembly code programmers similarly virtualize effects, and would benefit from similar abstractions if possible. However, the implementation details of effects seem disconnected from the high-level monad interface: at this lower level much of the design is in the layout of the runtime stack, which is not accessible in a high-level programming language. We demonstrate that the monadic interface can be faithfully adapted from high-level functional programming to a lower level setting with explicit stack manipulation. We use a polymorphic call-by-push-value (CBPV) calculus as a setting that captures the essence of stack-manipulation, with a type system that allows programs to define domain-specific stack structures. Within this setting, we show that the existing category-theoretic notion of a relative monad can be used to model the stack-based implementation of computational effects. To demonstrate generality, we adapt a variety of standard monads to relative monads. Additionally, we show that stack-manipulating programs can benefit from a generalization of do-notation we call \"monadic blocks\" that allow all CBPV code to be reinterpreted to work with an arbitrary relative monad. As an application, we show that all relative monads extend automatically to relative monad transformers, a process which is not automatic for monads in pure languages.",

    "abstract": "In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus, the linear classical L-calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics for the calculus is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. In order to tackle this issue, we define a notion of adjunction between graph morphisms on non-associative categories, which we use to formulate polarized and non-associative notions of symmetric monoidal closed duploid and of dialogue duploid. We show that they provide a direct style counterpart to adjunction models: linear effect adjunctions for the (linear) call-by-push-value calculus and dialogue chiralities for linear continuations, respectively. In particular, we show that the syntax of the linear classical L-calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).",

In fact, as proved by Harding in [5], this K is then left adjoint to the forgetful functor from orthomodular posets to bounded posets. This adjunction gives rise to a monad on the category of bounded posets, which we call the Kalmbach monad. For every monad (T, η, μ) on a category C, there is a standard notion EilenbergMoore category C (sometimes called the category of algebras or the category of modules for T ). The category C comes equipped with a canonical adjunction between C and C and this adjunction gives rise to the original monad T on C. In the present paper we prove that the Eilenberg-Moore category for the Kalmbach monad is isomorphic to the category of effect algebras.",

    "abstract": "Strong monads are important for several applications, in particular, in the denotational semantics of effectful languages, where strength is needed to sequence computations that have free variables. Strength is non-trivial: it can be difficult to determine whether a monad has any strength at all, and monads can be strong in multiple ways. We therefore review some of the most important known facts about strength and prove some new ones. In particular, we present a number of equivalent characterizations of strong functor and strong monad, and give some conditions that guarantee existence or uniqueness of strengths. We look at strength from three different perspectives: actions of a monoidal category V, enrichment over V, and powering over V. We are primarily motivated by semantics of effects, but the results are also useful in other contexts.",

We identify three equivalent conditions which characterise the existence of the centre of a strong monad (some of which relate it to the premonoidal centre of Power and Robinson) and we show that every strong monad on many well-known naturally occurring categories does admit a centre, thereby showing that this new notion is ubiquitous.

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Abstract It is well established that equational algebraic theories and the monads they generate can be used to encode computational effects. An important insight of Power and Shkaravska is that comodels of an algebraic theory \n$\\mathbb{T}$\n – i.e., models in the opposite category \n$\\mathcal{S}\\mathrm{et}^{\\mathrm{op}}$\n – provide a suitable environment for evaluating the computational effects encoded by \n$\\mathbb{T}$\n . As already noted by Power and Shkaravska, taking comodels yields a functor from accessible monads to accessible comonads on \n$\\mathcal{S}\\mathrm{et}$\n . In this paper, we show that this functor is part of an adjunction – the “costructure–cosemantics adjunction” of the title – and undertake a thorough investigation of its properties. We show that, on the one hand, the cosemantics functor takes its image in what we term the presheaf comonads induced by small categories; and that, on the other, costructure takes its image in the presheaf monads induced by small categories. In particular, the cosemantics comonad of an accessible monad will be induced by an explicitly-described category called its behaviour category that encodes the static and dynamic properties of the comodels. Similarly, the costructure monad of an accessible comonad will be induced by a behaviour category encoding static and dynamic properties of the comonad coalgebras. We tie these results together by showing that the costructure–cosemantics adjunction is idempotent, with fixpoints to either side given precisely by the presheaf monads and comonads. Along the way, we illustrate the value of our results with numerous examples drawn from computation and mathematics.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Reversible computing is motivated by both pragmatic and foundational considerations arising from a variety of disciplines. We take a particular path through the development of reversible computation, emphasizing compositional reversible computation. We start from a historical perspective, by reviewing those approaches that developed reversible extensions of lambda-calculi, Turing machines, and communicating process calculi. These approaches share a common challenge: computations made reversible in this way do not naturally compose locally. We then turn our attention to computational models that eschew the detour via existing irreversible models. Building on an original analysis by Landauer, the insights of Bennett, Fredkin, and Toffoli introduced a fresh approach to reversible computing in which reversibility is elevated to the status of the main design principle. These initial models are expressed using low-level bit manipulations, however. Abstracting from the low-level of the Bennett-Fredkin-Toffoli models and pursuing more intrinsic, typed, and algebraic models, naturally leads to rig categories as the canonical model for compositional reversible programming. The categorical model reveals connections to type isomorphisms, symmetries, permutations, groups, and univalent universes. This, in turn, paves the way for extensions to reversible programming based on monads and arrows. These extensions are shown to recover conventional irreversible programming, a variety of reversible computational effects, and more interestingly both pure (measurement-free) and measurement-based quantum programming.",

Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor. Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\\otimes$ of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the\"lax smash product\"of pointed $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\\wedge$-square of the\"walking adjunction\"and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the lax-$\\wedge$-square of the\"walking monad\"corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\\{\\text{walking monad}\\} \\to \\{\\text{walking adjunction}\\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode.

    "abstract": "We exhibit an adjunction between a category of abstract algebras of partial functions that we call difference-restriction algebras and a category of Hausdorff \\'etale spaces. Difference-restriction algebras are those algebras isomorphic to a collection of partial functions closed under relative complement and domain restriction. Our adjunction generalises the adjunction between the category of generalised Boolean algebras and the category of Hausdorff spaces. We define the finitary compatible completion of a difference-restriction algebra and show that the monad induced by our adjunction yields the finitary compatible completion of any difference-restriction algebra. As a corollary, the adjunction restricts to a duality between the finitarily compatibly complete difference-restriction algebras and the locally compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff \\'etale spaces, generalising the duality between generalised Boolean algebras and locally compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces. We then extend these adjunction, duality, and completion results to difference-restriction algebras equipped with arbitrary additional compatibility preserving operators.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Firstly, precise conditions on how to obtain very-well-behaved epireflections are explored and improved from the author's previous papers; meaning that, beginning with a monad and a prefactorization system on a category, is produced a reflection with stable units (stronger than semi-left-exactness, also called admissibility in categorical Galois Theory) and an associated monotone-light factorization. Then, we were able to show that, for a pseudo-filtered category J in which every arrow is a monomorphism, the colimit functor on Set^J produces a very-well-behaved epireflection; if J = 2 the monotone-light factorization is non-trivial, as showed as an example. Then, new results are presented that grant very-well-behaved subreflections from the very-well-behaved reflections induced by an adjunction given by right Kan extensions for presheaves. These subreflections are obtained by restricting to the models of a sketch; it is showed finally that the known very-well-behaved reflection of n-categories into n-preorders is an example of this process (being n any positive integer).",

    "abstract": "Graded monads refine traditional monads using effect annotations in order to describe quantitatively the computational effects that a program can generate. They have been successfully applied to a variety of formal systems for reasoning about effectful computations. However, existing categorical frameworks for graded monads do not support effects that may depend on program values, which we call dependent effects, thereby limiting their expressiveness. We address this limitation by introducing indexed graded monads, a categorical generalization of graded monads inspired by the fibrational\"indexed\"view and by classical categorical semantics of dependent type theories. We show how indexed graded monads provide semantics for a refinement type system with dependent effects. We also show how this type system can be instantiated with specific choices of parameters to obtain several formal systems for reasoning about specific program properties. These instances include, in particular, cost analysis, probability-bound reasoning, expectation-bound reasoning, and temporal safety verification.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Although numerous contributions from divers authors, over the past fifteen years or so, have brought enriched category theory to a developed state, there is still no connected account of the theory, or even of a substantial part of it. As the applications of the theory continue to expand - some recent examples are given below - the lack of such an account is the more acutely felt. The present book is designed to supply the want in part, by giving a fairly complete treatment of the limited area to which the title refers. The basic concepts of category theory certainly include the notion of functor-category, of limit and colimit, of Kan extension, and of density; with their applications to completions, perhaps including those relative completions given by categories of algebras for limit-defined theories. If we read 'V-category' for 'category' here, this is essentially the list of our chapter-headings below, after the first chapter introducing V-categories.  In fact our scope is wider than this might suggest; for what we give is also a selfcontained account of basic category theory as described above, assuming as prior knowledge only the most elementary categorical concepts, and treating the ordinary and enriched cases together from Chapter 3 on.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Connectionist approaches to machine learning, \\emph{i.e.} neural networks, are enjoying a considerable vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category-theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, We generalise from vectors to co-presheaves, and describe VSA operations as the right Kan extensions of the external tensor product. This formalisation involves a proof that the right Kan extension in such cases can be expressed as simple, element-wise operations. We validate our formalisation with worked examples that connect to current VSA implementations, while suggesting new possible designs for VSAs.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In this article we develop formal category theory within augmented virtual double categories. Notably we formalise the classical notions of Kan extension, Yoneda embedding $\\text y_A\\colon A \\to \\hat A$, exact square, total category and 'small' cocompletion; the latter in an appropriate sense. Throughout we compare our formalisations to their corresponding $2$-categorical counterparts. Our approach has several advantages. For instance, the structure of augmented virtual double categories naturally allows us to isolate conditions that ensure small cocompleteness of formal presheaf objects $\\hat A$. Given a monoidal augmented virtual double category $\\mathcal K$ with a Yoneda embedding $\\text y_I \\colon I \\to \\hat I$ for its monoidal unit $I$ we prove that, for any 'unital' object $A$ in $\\mathcal K$ that has a 'horizontal dual' $A^\\circ$, the Yoneda embedding $\\text y_A \\colon A \\to \\hat A$ exists if and only if the 'inner hom' $[A^\\circ, \\hat I]$ exists. This result is a special case of a more general result that, given a functor $F\\colon \\mathcal K \\to \\mathcal L$ of augmented virtual double categories, allows a Yoneda embedding in $\\mathcal L$ to be\"lifted\", along a pair of 'universal morphisms' in $\\mathcal L$, to a Yoneda embedding in $\\mathcal K$.",

    "abstract": "On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.",

Achieving an accuracy of 93.5% and an ROCAUC of 0.98, the performance of this algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms tested on the Occupancy dataset.

    "abstract": "Whereas formal category theory is classically considered within a $2$-category, in this paper a double-dimensional approach is taken. More precisely we develop such theory within the setting of hypervirtual double categories, a notion extending that of virtual double category by adding cells with nullary target. \n[...] After this the notion of `weak' Kan extension within a hypervirtual double category is considered, together with three strengthenings. [...] The notion of yoneda embedding is then considered in a hypervirtual double category, and compared to that of a good yoneda structure on a $2$-category; the latter in the sense of Street-Walters and Weber. Conditions are given ensuring that a yoneda embedding $y \\colon A \\to \\hat A$ defines $\\hat A$ as the free small cocompletion of $A$, in a suitable sense. \nIn the second half we consider formal category theory in the presence of algebraic structures. In detail: to a monad $T$ on a hypervirtual double category $\\mathcal K$ several hypervirtual double categories $T\\text-\\mathsf{Alg}_{(v, w)}$ of $T$-algebras are associated, [...]. This is followed by the study of the creation of, amongst others, left Kan extensions by the forgetful functors $T\\text-\\mathsf{Alg}_{(v, w)} \\to \\mathcal K$. The main motivation of this paper is the description of conditions ensuring that yoneda embeddings in $\\mathcal K$ lift along these forgetful functors, as well as ensuring that such lifted algebraic yoneda embeddings again define free small cocompletions, now in $T\\text-\\mathsf{Alg}_{(v, w)}$. As a first example we apply the previous to monoidal structures on categories, hence recovering Day convolution of presheaves and Im-Kelly's result on free monoidal cocompletion, as well as obtaining a \"monoidal Yoneda lemma\".",

    "abstract": "Given a compact Lie group $G$ acting on a space $X$, the classical Atiyah-Segal completion theorem identifies topological $K$-theory of the homotopy quotient $X/G$ with an explicit completion of $G$-equivariant topological $K$-theory of $X$. We prove an analog of this result for algebraic $K$-theory over a field of characteristic 0. In our setting $G$ is a reductive group that acts on a derived algebraic space $X$ with the assumption that all stabilizer groups are nice (in the sense of Alper). Our main result identifies the value $R^{\\mathrm{dAff}}K([X/G])$ of right Kan extension of the $K$-theory functor from schemes to stacks with the completion of $K$-theory of the category $\\mathrm{Perf}([X/G])$ at the augmentation ideal of $K_0(\\mathrm{Rep}(G))$. The main novelty of our results is that $X$ is allowed to be singular or even derived. This generality is achieved by employing and improving analogous versions of completion theorem for negative cyclic homology (after Ben-Zvi--Nadler and Chen) and for homotopy $K$-theory (after van den Bergh--Tabuada). We also show that in the singular setting the completion theorem does not necessarily hold without the nice stabilizer assumption.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new model structure on the category of dendroidal spaces, designed to provide a further model for the homotopy theory of $\\infty$-operads. This model is directly analogous to a recent construction on the category of simplicial spaces by Moser and Nuiten, and can be seen as its dendroidal counterpart. In our new model structure, the fibrant objects are the dendroidal Segal spaces, while the cofibrations form a subclass of those in the Segal space model structure. The weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely the Dwyer--Kan equivalences, and the fibrations between them are the isofibrations. We prove that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to the Cisinski--Moerdijk model structures on dendroidal sets and dendroidal spaces, thereby establishing a compatible extension of the theory of $\\infty$-categories to the operadic setting.",

The Kan extension is a powerful tool in category theory that generalizes this notion. In this work we explore several applications of Kan extensions to data science. We begin by deriving a simple classification algorithm as a Kan extension and experimenting with this algorithm on real data. Next, we use the Kan extension to derive a procedure for learning clustering algorithms from labels and explore the performance of this procedure on real data. We then investigate how Kan extensions can be used to learn a general mapping from datasets of labeled examples to functions and to approximate a complex function with a simpler one.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formalize precisely the sense in which the application of a cellular automaton to partial configurations is a natural extension of its local transition function through the categorical notion of Kan extension. In fact, the two possible ways to do such an extension and the ingredients involved in their definition are related through Kan extensions in many ways. These relations provide additional links between computer science and category theory, and also give a new point of view on the famous Curtis–Hedlund theorem of cellular automata from the extended topological point of view provided by category theory. These links also allow to relatively easily generalize concepts pioneered by cellular automata to arbitrary kinds of possibly evolving spaces. No prior knowledge of category theory is assumed for the most part.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We present a cubical type theory based on the Cartesian cube category (faces, degeneracies, symmetries, diagonals, but no connections or reversal) with univalent universes, each containing Π, Σ, path, identity, natural number, boolean, suspension, and glue (equivalence extension) types. The type theory includes a syntactic description of a uniform Kan operation, along with judgmental equality rules defining the Kan operation on each type. The Kan operation uses both a different set of generating trivial cofibrations and a different set of generating cofibrations than the Cohen, Coquand, Huber, and Mörtberg (CCHM) model. Next, we describe a constructive model of this type theory in Cartesian cubical sets. We give a mechanized proof, using Agda as the internal language of cubical sets in the style introduced by Orton and Pitts, that glue, Π, Σ, path, identity, boolean, natural number, suspension types, and the universe itself are Kan in this model, and that the universe is univalent. An advantage of this formal approach is that our construction can also be interpreted in a range of other models, including cubical sets on the connections cube category and the De Morgan cube category, as used in the CCHM model, and bicubical sets, as used in directed type theory.",

    "abstract": "Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical context for differential geometry. In a previous paper, a formal approach was adopted to provide a genuine Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent categories by introducing tangentads. A tangentad is to a tangent category as a formal monad is to a monad of a category. In this paper, we discuss the formal notion of tangentads, construct a $2$-comonad structure on the $2$-functor of tangentads, and introduce Cartesian, adjunctable, and representable tangentads. We also reinterpret the subtangent structure with negatives of a tangent structure as a right Kan extension. Furthermore, we present numerous examples of tangentads, such as tangent (split) restriction categories, tangent fibrations, tangent monads, display tangent categories, and infinitesimal objects. Finally, we employ the formal approach to prove that every tangent monad admits the construction of algebras, provided the underlying monad does, and show that tangent split restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to tangent $\\mathscr{M}$-categories.",

    "title": "Understanding Scaling Laws with Statistical and Approximation Theory for Transformer Neural Networks on Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often observed to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the data size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for transformer-based large language models, where networks with billions of parameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained widespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws exist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical estimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the input data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts a power law between the generalization error and both the training data size and the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic dimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture is shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging low-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to explain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry. Moreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on natural language datasets. We find the observed empirical data scaling laws closely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results rigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity affecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a structured approach to deep neural networks (DNNs) through the lens of category theory, establishing a generalized formalism that aligns neural network architecture with algebraic structures and mappings. By representing neural networks as category-theoretic objects, such as modules and morphisms, I redefine layers and connections as structured relationships between data and model parameters. The framework accommodates categorical and numerical features alike, employing Kronecker delta functions for encoding categorical data via one-hot vectors, and allowing for the transformation of feature sets into matrices for GPU-parallel computation. I propose the use of R-modules and related algebraic constructs to structure the weights and bias terms as linear transformations, extending standard neural operations into a cohesive category-theoretic model. The framework aims to offer a unified view of neural networks, where the entire architecture is seen as a network of \"axons\"—a sequence of mappings between layers—enabling efficient operations, modular design, and potential advances in understanding neural network behavior. This perspective integrates easily with deep learning frameworks and offers insights into potential design innovations within object-oriented programming (OOP) environments for DNNs.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The behavior of neural networks still remains opaque, and a recently widely noted phenomenon is that networks often achieve similar performance when initialized with different random parameters. This phenomenon has attracted significant attention in measuring the similarity between features learned by distinct networks. However, feature similarity could be vague in describing the same feature since equivalent features hardly exist. In this paper, we expand the concept of equivalent feature and provide the definition of what we call functionally equivalent features. These features produce equivalent output under certain transformations. Using this definition, we aim to derive a more intrinsic metric for the so-called feature complexity regarding the redundancy of features learned by a neural network at each layer. We offer a formal interpretation of our approach through the lens of category theory, a well-developed area in mathematics. To quantify the feature complexity, we further propose an efficient algorithm named Iterative Feature Merging. Our experimental results validate our ideas and theories from various perspectives. We empirically demonstrate that the functionally equivalence widely exists among different features learned by the same neural network and we could reduce the number of parameters of the network without affecting the performance.The IFM shows great potential as a data-agnostic model prune method. We have also drawn several interesting empirical findings regarding the defined feature complexity.",

    "title": "Tuberculosis Detection From Chest X-Ray Image Modalities Based on Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne disease with a high fatality rate that often affects people’s lungs. Early detection of the disease can guarantee a cure, but that is not the case due to the lack of experts and screening facilities. With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, publicly available clinical datasets and high computer systems, several solutions have been proposed to automate the diagnosing process based on deep learning (DL) algorithms. This study presents a DL technique based on a combined Data efficient image transformer and the Residual Network-16 (ResNet-16) model for effective TB diagnosis from X-ray images. The TBX11K dataset got utilized for this investigation. The dataset has three categories—Healthy, Sick but non-TB and TB. Relying on only healthy X-rays as the negative category in clinical settings where there are many unwell but non-TB samples can cause considerable false positives in the model prediction, hence the adoption of the sick but non-TB class. The dataset got divided into training, validation, and testing sets for the experiment. The self-attention mechanism within the transformer part of the proposed model learns crucial information and constructs the relationship between image tokens. The ResNet-16 part uses depth-wise convolution to gather local representations and reduce computing costs while increasing the diagnosing accuracy. The global average pooling is applied to the feature maps at the final convolution layer to generate heatmaps based on the class activation map to show exactly where the prediction happened. The suggested model obtained TB diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision rates of 99.38%, 99.49%, 99.26% and 99.24%, respectively. Additionally, it is lightweight (6.9M) and detects more quickly (4.79ms) than the other comparative cutting-edge versions. The suggested model’s exceptional results demonstrate its effectiveness in TB detection, allowing for practical use.",

    "abstract": "The neural-network quantum states (NNQS) method is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool in quantum mechanisms. While significant advancements have been achieved in simulating simple molecules using NNQS, the ab initio simulation of complex solid-state materials remains challenging. Here in this work, we have adopted the periodic density matrix embedding theory to extend the NNQS method to deal with complex solid-state systems. Our approach notably reduces the computational problem size while maintaining high accuracy. We have validated the accuracy and efficiency of our method against traditional methodologies and experimental data in extended systems, and have investigated the magnetic ordering and charge density wave state in transition metal compounds. The findings from our research indicate that the integration of quantum embedding with intuitive chemical fragmentation can significantly enhance the NNQS simulation of realistic materials.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Transformer-based Neural Quantum Digital Twins (Tx-NQDTs) to simulate full adiabatic dynamics of many-body quantum systems, including ground and low-lying excited states, at low computational cost. Tx-NQDTs employ a graph-informed Transformer neural network trained to predict spectral properties (energy levels and gap locations) needed for annealing schedule design. We integrate these predictions with an adaptive annealing schedule design based on first-order adiabatic perturbation theory (FOAPT), which slows the evolution near predicted small gaps to maintain adiabaticity. Experiments on a D-Wave quantum annealer (N = 10, 15, 20 qubits, 12 control segments) show that Tx-NQDT-informed schedules significantly improve success probabilities despite hardware noise and calibration drift. The optimized schedules achieve success probabilities 2.2-11.7 percentage points higher than the default linear schedule, outperforming the D-Wave baseline in 44 of 60 cases. These results demonstrate a practical, data-driven route to improved quantum annealing performance on real hardware.",

Therefore, timely diagnosis of transformer fault types is the most important task to ensure the stable operation of power system.

A comprehensive diagnosis method of transformer fault based on the fusion of multi neural network and evidence theory based on cloud computing is proposed.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\\% time savings compared to manual approaches.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar has been extensively used in numerous fields and can gather a wealth of information about the area of interest. This large-scene data-intensive technology puts a high value on automatic target recognition (ATR) which can free the utilizers and boost the efficiency. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it possible to create a deep learning-based SAR ATR that can automatically identify target features from massive input data. In the last 6 years, intensive research has been conducted in this area, however, most papers in the current SAR ATR field used recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-varied models to deepen the regime's understanding of the SAR images. To equip SAR ATR with updated deep learning technology, this paper tries to apply a lightweight vision transformer (LViT)-based model to classify SAR images. The entire structure was verified by an open-accessed SAR data set and recognition results show that the final classification outcomes are robust and more accurate in comparison with referred traditional network structures without even using any convolutional layers.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the inner workings of neural networks, including transformers, remains one of the most challenging puzzles in machine learning. This study introduces a novel approach by applying the principles of gauge symmetries, a key concept in physics, to neural network architectures. By regarding model functions as physical observables, we find that parametric redundancies of various machine learning models can be interpreted as gauge symmetries. We mathematically formulate the parametric redundancies in neural ODEs, and find that their gauge symmetries are given by spacetime diffeomorphisms, which play a fundamental role in Einstein’s theory of gravity. Viewing neural ODEs as a continuum version of feedforward neural networks, we show that the parametric redundancies in feedforward neural networks are indeed lifted to diffeomorphisms in neural ODEs. We further extend our analysis to transformer models, finding natural correspondences with neural ODEs and their gauge symmetries. The concept of gauge symmetries sheds light on the complex behavior of deep learning models through physics and provides us with a unifying perspective for analyzing various machine learning architectures.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "In the field of electric carbon, the mapping relationship between carbon emission flow calculation and power flow calculation was studied by combining techniques such as current trajectory tracking, carbon flow trajectory analysis, power system flow calculation methods, and electric network analysis theory. By delving into the mechanism between these two factors, a better understanding of the correlation between them can be achieved. In addition, by using time series data, graph attention neural networks (GNN), distributed computing technology, and spatiotemporal computing engines, carbon emission fluctuations can be decomposed and a high-frequency “energy-electricity-carbon” integrated dynamic emission factor can be achieved. Through the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of this dynamic factor in multiple dimensions, the carbon emissions from key industries in cities can be accurately calculated. In this paper, the LSTM-GAT model is used as the core to construct a key carbon emission prediction model for cities. The study focuses on the power plant, chemical industry, steel, transportation industry, and construction industry, which are high energy-consuming industries with an annual electricity consumption of more than 100 million kWh in a major city of China. By analyzing the entire life cycle from power generation to electricity consumption and conducting current flow analysis, monthly, weekly, and daily carbon emission calculations were performed. Additionally, other factors such as the industrial development index, GDP, coverage area of power generation enterprises, regional population, size, and type of power-consuming units were included in the comprehensive calculation to build a measurement system. By conducting experiments and analyzing historical data, we have found that the LSTM-GAT model outperforms the single models of GCN, GAT, LSTM, GRU, and RNN in terms of lower error values and higher accuracy. The LSTM-GAT model is better suited for predicting carbon emissions and related indicators with an accuracy rate of 89.5%. Our predictions show that the carbon emissions will exhibit a slow growth trend in the future, while the carbon emission intensity will decrease. This information can provide a scientific basis for government decision-making.",

The proposed architecture is gauge covariant/equivariant, ensuring it respects gauge symmetry on the lattice, and is also equivariant under spacetime symmetries such as rotations and translations on the lattice. A key feature of our approach lies in the attention matrix, which forms the core of the Transformer architecture. To preserve symmetries, we define the attention matrix using a Frobenius inner product between link variables and extended staples. This construction ensures that the attention matrix remains invariant under gauge transformations, thereby making the entire Transformer architecture covariant. We evaluated the performance of the gauge covariant Transformer in the context of self-learning HMC. Numerical experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves higher performance compared to the gauge covariant neural networks, demonstrating its potential to improve lattice QCD calculations.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Segmentation on the left atrium from magnetic resonance imaging scans is a crucial task for the clinical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have demonstrated their advantages in recent years, but they often suffer from the difficulty to process high uncertainty of some regions. Focusing on the cognitive uncertainty in deep neural networks, we build an uncertainty-aware model based on anchor fuzzy sets in this article. A fuzzy entropy measure defined on membership functions is employed to quantify the uncertainty induced by an anchor's membership degrees to the individual categories. A key insight in this study is that the anchor regions with higher uncertainty are considered to include hard-generalized cases. Based on this prior of high uncertainty about image segmentation, the uncertainty-aware model exhibits the self-learning attention that sheds light on the regions the deep learning should focus on. In addition, our segmentation model with an uncertainty-aware plug-in unit highlights its nonlocal perception due to Fourier convolution and global self-attention mechanism. Experiments show that our model can achieve competitive results on left atrium segmentation tasks. This article provides some useful guidelines for using uncertainty modeling to improve the performance of deep learning systems for image segmentation tasks.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Forests are critical in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and the knowledge of their response to ongoing climate change will be crucial for determining future carbon fluxes and climate trajectories. In areas with contrasting seasons, trees form discrete annual rings that can be assigned to calendar years, allowing to extract valuable information about how trees respond to the environment. The anatomical structure of wood provides highly-resolved information about the reaction and adaptation of trees to climate. Quantitative wood anatomy helps to retrieve this information by measuring wood at the cellular level using high-resolution images of wood micro-sections. However, whereas large advances have been made in identifying cellular structures, obtaining meaningful cellular information is still hampered by the correct annual tree ring delimitation on the images. This is a time-consuming task that requires experienced operators to manually delimit ring boundaries. Classic methods of automatic segmentation based on pixel values are being replaced by new approaches using neural networks which are capable of distinguishing structures, even when demarcations require a high level of expertise. Although neural networks have been used for tree ring segmentation on macroscopic images of wood, the complexity of cell patterns in stained microsections of broadleaved species requires adaptive models to accurately accomplish this task. We present an automatic tree ring boundary delineation using neural networks on stained cross-sectional microsection images from beech cores. We trained a UNETR, a combined neural network of UNET and the attention mechanisms of Visual Transformers, to automatically segment annual ring boundaries. Its accuracy was evaluated considering discrepancies with manual segmentation and the consequences of disparity for the goals of quantitative wood anatomy analyses. In most cases (91.8%), automatic segmentation matched or improved manual segmentation, and the rate of vessels assignment to annual rings was similar between the two categories, even when manual segmentation was considered better. The application of convolutional neural networks-based models outperforms human operator segmentations when confronting ring boundary delimitation using specific parameters for quantitative wood anatomy analysis. Current advances on segmentation models may reduce the cost of massive and accurate data collection for quantitative wood anatomy.",

However, testing this theory remains challenging due to two reasons: the difficulty in defining what tasks are ecologically valid and building rational models for these tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that large language models can generate cognitive tasks, specifically category learning tasks, that match the statistics of real-world tasks, thereby addressing the first challenge. We tackle the second challenge by deriving rational agents adapted to these tasks using the framework of meta-learning, leading to a class of models called ecologically rational meta-learned inference (ERMI). ERMI quantitatively explains human data better than seven other cognitive models in two different experiments. It additionally matches human behavior on a qualitative level: (1) it finds the same tasks difficult that humans find difficult, (2) it becomes more reliant on an exemplar-based strategy for assigning categories with learning, and (3) it generalizes to unseen stimuli in a human-like way. Furthermore, we show that ERMI's ecologically valid priors allow it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark.",

However, neural models perform poorly in settings requiring compositional generalization beyond the training data -- particularly to rare or unseen subsequences. Past work has found symbolic scaffolding (e.g. grammars or automata) essential in these settings. Here we present a family of learned data augmentation schemes that support a large category of compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure. Our approach to data augmentation has two components: recombination of original training examples via a prototype-based generative model and resampling of generated examples to encourage extrapolation. Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a dataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves generalization in two language processing problems---instruction following (SCAN) and morphological analysis (Sigmorphon 2018)---where our approach enables learning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples.",

To control the scene composition, we use artificial images composed of multiple, translated and colored MNIST digits. In contrast to learning category labels, here we train deep neural networks to output the full compositional vector description of an input image. The output of the deep network can then be interpreted by a VSA resonator network, to extract object identity or other properties of indiviual objects. We evaluate the performance and generalization properties of the system on randomly generated scenes. Specifically, we show that the network is able to learn the task and generalize to unseen seen digit shapes and scene configurations. Further, the generalisation ability of the trained model is limited. For example, with a gap in the training data, like an object not shown in a particular image location during training, the learning does not automatically fill this gap.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a core role in activity understanding. As a compositional learning problem (human-verb-object), studying its generalization matters. However, widely-used metric mean average precision (mAP) fails to model the compositional generalization well. Thus, we propose a novel metric, mPD (mean Performance Degradation), as a complementary of mAP to evaluate the performance gap among compositions of different objects and the same verb. Surprisingly, mPD reveals that previous methods usually generalize poorly. With mPD as a cue, we propose Object Category (OC) Immunity to boost HOI generalization. The idea is to prevent model from learning spurious object-verb correlations as a short-cut to over-fit the train set. To achieve OC-immunity, we propose an OC-immune network that decouples the inputs from OC, extracts OC-immune representations, and leverages uncertainty quantification to generalize to unseen objects. In both conventional and zero-shot experiments, our method achieves decent improvements. To fully evaluate the generalization, we design a new and more difficult benchmark, on which we present significant advantage. The code is available at https://github.com/Foruck/OC-Immunity.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from known subconcepts. However, it is still challenging since the intricate interaction between subconcepts is entangled with their corresponding visual features, which affects the recognition accuracy of concepts. Besides, the domain gap between training and testing data leads to the model poor generalization. In this article, we tackle these problems by exploring partial semantic consistency (PSC) to eliminate visual deviation to guarantee the discrimination and generalization of representations. Considering the complicated interaction between subconcepts and their visual features, we decompose seen images into visual elements according to their labels and obtain the instance-level subdeviations from compositions, which is utilized to excavate the category-level primitives of subconcepts. Furthermore, we present a multiscale concept composition (MSCC) approach to produce virtual samples from two aspects, which augments the sufficiency and diversity of samples so that the proposed model can generalize to novel compositions. Extensive experiments indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Algorithmicists are well-aware that fast dynamic programming algorithms are very often the correct choice when computing on compositional (or even recursive) graphs. Here we initiate the study of how to generalize this folklore intuition to mathematical structures writ large. We achieve this horizontal generality by adopting a categorial perspective which allows us to show that: (1) structured decompositions (a recent, abstract generalization of many graph decompositions) define Grothendieck topologies on categories of data (adhesive categories) and that (2) any computational problem which can be represented as a sheaf with respect to these topologies can be decided in linear time on classes of inputs which admit decompositions of bounded width and whose decomposition shapes have bounded feedback vertex number. This immediately leads to algorithms on objects of any C-set category; these include -- to name but a few examples -- structures such as: symmetric graphs, directed graphs, directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, directed hypergraphs, databases, simplicial complexes, circular port graphs and half-edge graphs. Thus we initiate the bridging of tools from sheaf theory, structural graph theory and parameterized complexity theory; we believe this to be a very fruitful approach for a general, algebraic theory of dynamic programming algorithms. Finally we pair our theoretical results with concrete implementations of our main algorithmic contribution in the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Discriminative models for object classification typically learn image-based representations that do not capture the compositional and 3D nature of objects. In this work, we show that explicitly integrating 3D compositional object representations into deep networks for image classification leads to a largely enhanced generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios. In particular, we introduce a novel architecture, referred to as NOVUM, that consists of a feature extractor and a neural object volume for every target object class. Each neural object volume is a composition of 3D Gaussians that emit feature vectors. This compositional object representation allows for a highly robust and fast estimation of the object class by independently matching the features of the 3D Gaussians of each category to features extracted from an input image. Additionally, the object pose can be estimated via inverse rendering of the corresponding neural object volume. To enable the classification of objects, the neural features at each 3D Gaussian are trained discriminatively to be distinct from (i) the features of 3D Gaussians in other categories, (ii) features of other 3D Gaussians of the same object, and (iii) the background features. Our experiments show that NOVUM offers intriguing advantages over standard architectures due to the 3D compositional structure of the object representation, namely: (1) An exceptional robustness across a spectrum of real-world and synthetic out-of-distribution shifts and (2) an enhanced human interpretability compared to standard models, all while maintaining real-time inference and a competitive accuracy on in-distribution data.",

    "abstract": "Humans can learn and reason under substantial uncertainty in a space of infinitely many concepts, including structured relational concepts (\"a scene with objects that have the same color\") and ad-hoc categories defined through goals (\"objects that could fall on one's head\"). In contrast, standard classification benchmarks: 1) consider only a fixed set of category labels, 2) do not evaluate compositional concept learning and 3) do not explicitly capture a notion of reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce a new few-shot, meta-learning benchmark, Compositional Reasoning Under Uncertainty (CURI) to bridge this gap. CURI evaluates different aspects of productive and systematic generalization, including abstract understandings of disentangling, productive generalization, learning boolean operations, variable binding, etc. Importantly, it also defines a model-independent \"compositionality gap\" to evaluate the difficulty of generalizing out-of-distribution along each of these axes. Extensive evaluations across a range of modeling choices spanning different modalities (image, schemas, and sounds), splits, privileged auxiliary concept information, and choices of negatives reveal substantial scope for modeling advances on the proposed task. All code and datasets will be available online.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "This thesis aims to develop a compositional theory for the operational semantics of networks. The networks considered are described by either internal or enriched graphs. In the internal case we focus on $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets, a generalization of Petri nets based on a Lawvere theory $\\mathsf{Q}$. $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets include many known variants of Petri nets including pre-nets, integer nets, elementary net systems, and bounded nets. In the enriched case we focus on graphs enriched in a quantale $R$ regarded as matrices with entries in $R$. These $R$-matrices represent distance networks, Markov processes, capacity networks, non-deterministic finite automata, simple graphs, and more. The operational semantics of $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets is constructed as an adjunction between $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and categories internal to the category of models of $\\mathsf{Q}$. Similarly, the operational semantics of $R$-matrices is constructed as an adjunction between $R$-matrices and categories enriched in $R$. The left adjoint of this adjunction sends an $R$-matrix $M$ to the $R$-category $F_R(M)$ whose hom-objects are solutions of the algebraic path problem: a generalization of the shortest path problem to graphs weighted in $R$. For both $\\mathsf{Q}$-nets and $R$-matrices we use the theory of structured cospans to study the compositionality of the above operational semantics. For each type of network we construct a double category whose morphisms are\"open networks\", i.e. networks with certain vertices designated as input or output. We introduce the black-boxing of an open network, a profunctor describing the externally observable behavior of an open network. We introduce a class of open networks called\"functional open networks\"for which black-boxing preserves composition.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need in order to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorially large number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn those rules? We investigate these questions in the context of diffusion models both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider a simple probabilistic context-free grammar - a tree-like graphical model used to represent the hierarchical and compositional structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn the grammar's composition rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on an intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but lacking global coherence. We test these predictions across different domains and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.",

    "title": "Atomic-to-Compositional Generalization for Mobile Agents with A New Benchmark and Scheduling System",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This article serves as a preliminary introduction to the design of a new, open-source applied and computational category theory framework, named Categorica, built on top of the Wolfram Language. Categorica allows one to configure and manipulate abstract quivers, categories, groupoids, diagrams, functors and natural transformations, and to perform a vast array of automated abstract algebraic computations using (arbitrary combinations of) the above structures; to manipulate and abstractly reason about arbitrary universal properties, including products, coproducts, pullbacks, pushouts, limits and colimits; and to manipulate, visualize and compute with strict (symmetric) monoidal categories, including full support for automated string diagram rewriting and diagrammatic theorem-proving. In so doing, Categorica combines the capabilities of an abstract computer algebra framework (thus allowing one to compute directly with epimorphisms, monomorphisms, retractions, sections, spans, cospans, fibrations, etc.) with those of a powerful automated theorem-proving system (thus allowing one to convert universal properties and other abstract constructions into (higher-order) equational logic statements that can be reasoned about and proved using standard automated theorem-proving methods, as well as to prove category-theoretic statements directly using purely diagrammatic methods). In this first of two articles introducing the design of the framework, we shall focus principally upon its handling of quivers, categories, diagrams, groupoids, functors and natural transformations, including demonstrations of both its algebraic manipulation and theorem-proving capabilities in each case.",

    "title": "String diagram rewrite theory II: Rewriting with symmetric monoidal structure",
    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Abstract Symmetric monoidal theories (SMTs) generalise algebraic theories in a way that make them suitable to express resource-sensitive systems, in which variables cannot be copied or discarded at will. In SMTs, traditional tree-like terms are replaced by string diagrams, topological entities that can be intuitively thought of as diagrams of wires and boxes. Recently, string diagrams have become increasingly popular as a graphical syntax to reason about computational models across diverse fields, including programming language semantics, circuit theory, quantum mechanics, linguistics, and control theory. In applications, it is often convenient to implement the equations appearing in SMTs as rewriting rules. This poses the challenge of extending the traditional theory of term rewriting, which has been developed for algebraic theories, to string diagrams. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of string diagram rewriting for SMTs. Our approach exploits the correspondence between string diagram rewriting and double pushout (DPO) rewriting of certain graphs, introduced in the first paper of this series. Such a correspondence is only sound when the SMT includes a Frobenius algebra structure. In the present work, we show how an analogous correspondence may be established for arbitrary SMTs, once an appropriate notion of DPO rewriting (which we call convex) is identified. As proof of concept, we use our approach to show termination of two SMTs of interest: Frobenius semi-algebras and bialgebras.",

    "title": "String Diagram Rewrite Theory I: Rewriting with Frobenius Structure",
    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "String diagrams are a powerful and intuitive graphical syntax, originating in theoretical physics and later formalised in the context of symmetric monoidal categories. In recent years, they have found application in the modelling of various computational structures, in fields as diverse as Computer Science, Physics, Control Theory, Linguistics, and Biology. In several of these proposals, transformations of systems are modelled as rewrite rules of diagrams. These developments require a mathematical foundation for string diagram rewriting: whereas rewrite theory for terms is well-understood, the two-dimensional nature of string diagrams poses quite a few additional challenges. This work systematises and expands a series of recent conference papers, laying down such a foundation. As a first step, we focus on the case of rewrite systems for string diagrammatic theories that feature a Frobenius algebra. This common structure provides a more permissive notion of composition than the usual one available in monoidal categories, and has found many applications in areas such as concurrency, quantum theory, and electrical circuits. Notably, this structure provides an exact correspondence between the syntactic notion of string diagrams modulo Frobenius structure and the combinatorial structure of hypergraphs. Our work introduces a combinatorial interpretation of string diagram rewriting modulo Frobenius structures in terms of double-pushout hypergraph rewriting. We prove this interpretation to be sound and complete and we also show that the approach can be generalised to rewriting modulo multiple Frobenius structures. As a proof of concept, we show how to derive from these results a termination strategy for Interacting Bialgebras, an important rewrite theory in the study of quantum circuits and signal flow graphs.",

    "title": "Category Theory Using String Diagrams",
    "year": 2014,
    "abstract": "In work of Fokkinga and Meertens a calculational approach to category theory is developed. The scheme has many merits, but sacrifices useful type information in the move to an equational style of reasoning. By contrast, traditional proofs by diagram pasting retain the vital type information, but poorly express the reasoning and development of categorical proofs. In order to combine the strengths of these two perspectives, we propose the use of string diagrams, common folklore in the category theory community, allowing us to retain the type information whilst pursuing a calculational form of proof. These graphical representations provide a topological perspective on categorical proofs, and silently handle functoriality and naturality conditions that require awkward bookkeeping in more traditional notation. \nOur approach is to proceed primarily by example, systematically applying graphical techniques to many aspects of category theory. We develop string diagrammatic formulations of many common notions, including adjunctions, monads, Kan extensions, limits and colimits. We describe representable functors graphically, and exploit these as a uniform source of graphical calculation rules for many category theoretic concepts. These graphical tools are then used to explicitly prove many standard results in our proposed diagrammatic style.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This paper explores the introduction of group structures within type theory, drawing from the algebraic theory proposed by Roy L. Crole. We define types with group structures and demonstrate that models of these types in categories with finite products can be interpreted as group objects. Each equation within the context of group theory types corresponds to a commutative diagram, representing the axioms of groups, inspired by Lawvere’s functorial semantics. Moreover, we clarify the role of control equations associated with fundamental properties of groups, such as operations and identities. By formalizing a type referred to as “Group Type,\" which involves integrating group operations and the equations they satisfy into an algebraic type, we incorporate the algebraic structure of a specific group into this type. This Group Type represents a concrete algebraic structure. In practical applications, the introduction of group structures into types is anticipated to optimize algorithms and data structures, leveraging the algebraic properties of groups to enhance computational efficiency. Furthermore, our exploration is not limited to mathematical conversions; it is also envisioned to extend to the application in various type systems, providing support for future research in formal verification and program analysis in computer science.",

The subject matter develops in a principled way, starting from the two dimensional syntax of key categorical concepts such as functors, adjunctions, and strictification, and leading up to Cartesian Closed Categories, the core mathematical model of the lambda calculus and of functional programming languages. This methodology inverts the usual approach of proceeding from syntax to a categorical interpretation, by rationally reconstructing a syntax from the categorical model. The result is a graph syntax -- more precisely, a hierarchical hypergraph syntax -- which in many ways is shown to be an improvement over the conventional linear term syntax. The rest of the tutorial focuses on applications of interest to programming languages: operational semantics, general frameworks for type inference, and complex whole-program transformations such as closure conversion and automatic differentiation.",

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "A great part of the mathematical foundations of topological quantum computation is given by the theory of modular categories which provides a description of the topological phases of matter such as anyon systems. In the near future the anyonic engineering will provide the anyonic devices from which the topological quantum computers will be constructed. From other side the string anyons are interesting topological phases of matter which can be described using mathematical constructions such as Frobenius algebras and open-closed string topological quantum field theories which are based on cobordism categories. Recently was proposed that is possible to obtain representations of cobordism categories using modular categories. In the present work, the modular categories resulting as representations of the 3 dimensional bordism 2 category are used with the aim to construct a new model of topological quantum computation. Such new model is named Sanyon Topological Quantum Computation and it is is theoretically performed by evolving non abelian string anyons (sanyons) using the Loop Braid Group and the open closed cobordism category. The output of the computation uniquely depends on how the sanyons have been braided by the Loop Braid Group and operated by the generators of the cobordism category. Small disturbances do not unravel the loop braids and the cobordisms, making the computation resistant to errors and decoherence.",
