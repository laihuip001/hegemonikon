    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionised artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling automatic feature extraction and function approximation from raw data. However, it faces challenges such as a lack of out-of-distribution generalisation, catastrophic forgetting and poor interpretability. In contrast, biological neural networks, such as those in the human brain, do not suffer from these issues, inspiring AI researchers to explore neuromimetic deep learning, which aims to replicate brain mechanisms within AI models. A foundational theory for this approach is the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which despite its potential, is often considered too complex to understand and implement in AI as it requires an interdisciplinary understanding across a variety of fields. This paper seeks to demystify the FEP and provide a comprehensive framework for designing neuromimetic models with human-like perception capabilities. We present a roadmap for implementing these models and a Pytorch code repository for applying FEP in a predictive coding network.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "In the realm of law enforcement, the “police hunch” has long been a mysterious but crucial aspect of decision-making. Drawing on the developing framework of Active Inference from cognitive science, this theoretical article examines the genesis, mechanics, and implications of the police hunch. It argues that hunches – often vital in high-stakes situations – should not be described as mere intuitions, but as intricate products of our mind’s generative models. These models, shaped by observations of the social world and assimilated and enacted through active inference, seek to reduce surprise and make hunches an indispensable tool for officers, in exactly the same way that hypotheses are indispensable for scientists. However, the predictive validity of hunches is influenced by a range of factors, including experience and bias, thus warranting critical examination of their reliability. This article not only explores the formation of police hunches but also provides practical insights for officers and researchers on how to harness the power of active inference to fully understand policing decisions and subsequently explore new avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives To study whether the free energy principle can explain fetal brain activity and the existence of fetal consciousness via a chaotic dimension derived using artificial intelligence. Methods In this observational study, we used a four-dimensional ultrasound technique obtained to collect images of fetal faces from pregnancies at 27–37 weeks of gestation, between February and December 2021. We developed an artificial intelligence classifier that recognizes fetal facial expressions, which are thought to relate to fetal brain activity. We then applied the classifier to video files of facial images to generate each expression category’s probabilities. We calculated the chaotic dimensions from the probability lists, and we created and investigated the free energy principle’s mathematical model that was assumed to be linked to the chaotic dimension. We used a Mann–Whitney test, linear regression test, and one-way analysis of variance for statistical analysis. Results The chaotic dimension revealed that the fetus had dense and sparse states of brain activity, which fluctuated at a statistically significant level. The chaotic dimension and free energy were larger in the sparse state than in the dense state. Conclusions The fluctuating free energy suggests consciousness seemed to exist in the fetus after 27 weeks.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) is used to measure cognitive flexibility. In WCST, the participants are required to estimate underlying rules (called \"category\" in WCST) from given sensory signals. Computational modeling of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST is important for elucidating flexible cognitive processing. In this study, we propose a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for explaining the underlying cognitive mechanisms of WCST, based on the free energy principle (FEP). FEP explains perception and goal-directed action as the minimization of prediction errors between predicted and real sensory signals (called free-energy minimization) and is expected to be an integrated theory of the brain. The primary characteristic of our model is that it considers free energy at future time steps, enabling it to correctly answer WCST as a goal-directed behavior based on the FEP. The simulation experiment showed that the proposed model successfully estimated the underlying categories to be estimated in WCST and correctly answer WCST. This indicates that the proposed model may provide mechanistic insights into flexible cognitive processing from the perspective of FEP.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a multifaceted condition that significantly impacts quality of life and poses challenges for effective management. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as hypnosis and mindfulness meditation, have emerged as promising approaches for alleviating pain. This review examines the mechanisms and comparative effectiveness of these therapies through the lens of the free energy principle, a unifying framework in neuroscience that conceptualizes pain as a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs, resulting in increased free energy. Hypnosis operates by leveraging top-down modulation to recalibrate the brain's predictive models, thereby reducing the sensory and affective dimensions of pain through the targeted engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, mindfulness fosters bottom-up sensory processing and acceptance, minimizing prediction errors by engaging the anterior insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex to promote emotional regulation and sensory integration. Comparative studies, including randomized trials in Veterans, demonstrate that both hypnosis and mindfulness provide sustained reductions in pain intensity, interference, and associated psychological symptoms, outperforming education-based controls. Hypnosis shows particular efficacy in altering sensory pain perception, while mindfulness excels in reducing emotional reactivity to pain. By integrating the free energy principle into the neuropsychological model of pain, this review highlights how these therapies recalibrate predictive coding processes to reduce pain perception. Future research should focus on optimizing these interventions and exploring their synergistic potential in clinical settings.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Friston proposed the Minimum Free Energy Principle (FEP) based on the Variational Bayesian (VB) method. This principle emphasizes that the brain and behavior coordinate with the environment, promoting self-organization. However, it has a theoretical flaw, a possibility of being misunderstood, and a limitation (only likelihood functions are used as constraints). This paper first introduces the semantic information G theory and the R(G) function (where R is the minimum mutual information for the given semantic mutual information G). The G theory is based on the P-T probability framework and, therefore, allows for the use of truth, membership, similarity, and distortion functions (related to semantics) as constraints. Based on the study of the R(G) function and logical Bayesian Inference, this paper proposes the Semantic Variational Bayesian (SVB) and the Maximum Information Efficiency (MIE) principle. Theoretic analysis and computing experiments prove that R − G = F − H(X|Y) (where F denotes VFE, and H(X|Y) is Shannon conditional entropy) instead of F continues to decrease when optimizing latent variables; SVB is a reliable and straightforward approach for latent variables and active inference. This paper also explains the relationship between information, entropy, free energy, and VFE in local non-equilibrium and equilibrium systems, concluding that Shannon information, semantic information, and VFE are analogous to the increment of free energy, the increment of exergy, and physical conditional entropy. The MIE principle builds upon the fundamental ideas of the FEP, making them easier to understand and apply. It needs to combine deep learning methods for wider applications.",

    "year": 2016,
    "abstract": "In this paper, we argue for a theoretical separation of the free-energy principle from Helmholtzian accounts of the predictive brain. The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.",

This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding, as proposed by the Bayesian brain hypothesis, and surrealism present an intriguing overlap. The Bayesian brain hypothesis views the brain as a probabilistic inference system that updates its beliefs based on sensory inputs, while surrealism explores the unconscious mind by challenging conventional thought and societal norms. This paper first demonstrates how the Bayesian brain hypothesis serves as a neo-surrealistic framework for understanding brain function. It then explores how the Bayesian brain hypothesis and surrealist techniques can be integrated to generate valuable insights about the human unconscious for art therapy. This convergence broadens scientific understanding by opening new avenues for research and practical applications at the intersection of neuroscience and art therapy, ultimately enhancing therapeutic outcomes for individuals seeking psychological support.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Abstract The free energy principle and its corollary, the active inference framework, serve as theoretical foundations in the domain of neuroscience, explaining the genesis of intelligent behavior. This principle states that the processes of perception, learning, and decision making—within an agent—are all driven by the objective of “minimizing free energy,” evincing the following behaviors: learning and employing a generative model of the environment to interpret observations, thereby achieving perception, and selecting actions to maintain a stable preferred state and minimize the uncertainty about the environment, thereby achieving decision making. This fundamental principle can be used to explain how the brain processes perceptual information, learns about the environment, and selects actions. Two pivotal tenets are that the agent employs a generative model for perception and planning and that interaction with the world (and other agents) enhances the performance of the generative model and augments perception. With the evolution of control theory and deep learning tools, agents based on the FEP have been instantiated in various ways across different domains, guiding the design of a multitude of generative models and decision-making algorithms. This letter first introduces the basic concepts of the FEP, followed by its historical development and connections with other theories of intelligence, and then delves into the specific application of the FEP to perception and decision making, encompassing both low-dimensional simple situations and high-dimensional complex situations. It compares the FEP with model-based reinforcement learning to show that the FEP provides a better objective function. We illustrate this using numerical studies of Dreamer3 by adding expected information gain into the standard objective function. In a complementary fashion, existing reinforcement learning, and deep learning algorithms can also help implement the FEP-based agents. Finally, we discuss the various capabilities that agents need to possess in complex environments and state that the FEP can aid agents in acquiring these capabilities.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The brain is a biological system comprising nerve cells and orchestrates its embodied agent’s perception, behavior, and learning in dynamic environments. The free-energy principle (FEP) advocated by Karl Friston explicates the local, recurrent, and self-supervised cognitive dynamics of the brain’s higher-order functions. In this study, we continue to refine the FEP through a physics-guided formulation; specifically, we apply our theory to synaptic learning by considering it an inference problem under the FEP and derive the governing equations, called Bayesian mechanics. Our study uncovers how the brain infers weight changes and postsynaptic activity, conditioned on the presynaptic input, by deploying generative models of the likelihood and prior belief. Consequently, we exemplify the synaptic efficacy in the brain with a simple model; in particular, we illustrate that the brain organizes an optimal trajectory in neural phase space during synaptic learning in continuous time, which variationally minimizes synaptic surprisal.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This paper delves into the application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the concept of the Markov blanket in understanding the neurocognitive implications of concussion. The FEP, a unifying theory in neuroscience, posits that the brain functions to minimize free energy, equating to a reduction in surprise or uncertainty regarding sensory inputs. The Markov blanket, defining the boundary between a system and its environment, is integral to this framework, particularly in understanding how the brain processes and responds to sensory information. We explore how a concussion might disrupt the brain's predictive processing and its ability to minimize free energy, leading to increased prediction errors and cognitive deficits. This disruption is hypothesized to manifest as an inability to accurately predict sensory inputs, resulting in impaired cognitive functions post-concussion. The paper also discusses the potential of neuroplasticity in concussion recovery, framed within the FEP as the brain's effort to re-establish minimized free energy under new constraints. We propose a methodological approach combining neuroimaging and computational modeling to empirically test these hypotheses. This theoretical exploration offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying concussion-induced cognitive impairments and suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation strategies.",

    "year": 2026,
    "abstract": "Cognitive fatigue is typically described as a psychobiological state that arises from intensive and/or prolonged cognitive performance and is experienced as a subjective feeling of exhaustion and lack of energy. It has been predominantly explained through models focused on internal resource depletion or diminished attention. Yet, such perspectives overlook the systemic and dynamic interplay between the brain and the environment. This article introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Friston's Free Energy Principle and informed by thermodynamic intuitions about open systems, conceptualizing cognitive fatigue as an outcome of the interaction between cognitive schema rigidity, increasing entropy, and imbalances between internal processes and external environmental demands. Cognitive schemas, which serve as stabilizing mental structures, play a key role in reducing uncertainty, maintaining cognitive stability, and supporting coherent perception–action. When their rigidity—rooted in cognitive inertia—limits their capacity to adapt to environmental changes, it hinders the brain's ability to externalize entropy. This results in an accumulation of unresolved internal disorder and heightened cognitive load, progressively exacerbating fatigue. This theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of brain-environment interactions in mitigating entropy accumulation and highlights the need for greater focus on schema flexibility to enhance cognitive adaptability. By integrating systemic and dynamic perspectives, this framework provides new insights into the mechanisms of cognitive fatigue and its implications for performance in demanding contexts.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is currently one of the most promising frameworks with which to address a unified explanation of life-related phenomena. With powerful formalism that embeds a small set of assumptions, it purports to deal with complex adaptive dynamics ranging from barely unicellular organisms to complex cultural manifestations. The FEP has received increased attention in disciplines that study life, including some critique regarding its overall explanatory power and its true potential as a grand unifying theory (GUT). Recently, FEP theorists presented a contribution with the main tenets of their framework, together with possible philosophical interpretations, which lean towards so-called Markovian Monism (MM). The present paper assumes some of the abovementioned critiques, rejects the arguments advanced to invalidate the FEP’s potential to be a GUT, and overcomes criticism thereof by reviewing FEP theorists’ newly minted metaphysical commitment, namely MM. Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), as an encompassing framework and a unified brain theory, has been widely applied to account for various problems in fields such as cognitive science, neuroscience, social interaction, and hermeneutics. As a computational model deeply rooted in math and statistics, FEP posits an optimization problem based on variational Bayes, which is solved either by dynamic programming or expectation maximization in practice. However, there seems to be a bottleneck in extending the FEP to machine learning and implementing such models with neural networks. This paper gives a preliminary attempt at bridging FEP and machine learning, via a classical neural network model, the Helmholtz machine. As a variational machine learning model, the Helmholtz machine is optimized by minimizing its free energy, the same objective as FEP. Although the Helmholtz machine is not temporal, it gives an ideal parallel to the vanilla FEP and the hierarchical model of the brain, under which the active inference and predictive coding could be formulated coherently. Besides a detailed theoretical discussion, the paper also presents a preliminary experiment to validate the hypothesis. By fine-tuning the trained neural network through active inference, the model performance is promoted to accuracy above 99\\%. In the meantime, the data distribution is continuously deformed to a salience that conforms to the model representation, as a result of active sampling.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "The Free-Energy-Principle (FEP) is an influential and controversial theory which postulates a deep connection between the stochastic thermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference. Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an information-theoretic functional – the variational free energy – and thus performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience, and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the construction of novel algorithms by which action, perception, and learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often made productive discussion challenging. Here, we aim to provide a mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and central claims of the FEP while also providing a discussion of the assumptions necessary and potential limitations of the theory. Additionally, since the FEP is a living theory, subject to internal controversy, change, and revision, we also present a detailed appendix highlighting and condensing current perspectives as well as controversies about the nature, applicability, and the mathematical assumptions and formalisms underlying the FEP. ar X iv :2 10 8. 13 34 3v 2 [ cs .A I] 1 O ct 2 02 1 A PREPRINT 5TH OCTOBER, 2021",

    "abstract": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is among the world’s most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Affecting an eighth of the world’s population, it often manifests as persistent apprehension which is difficult to control. Despite its prevalence, neuroscientific efforts to understand the cognitive mechanisms of GAD remain sparse. This has resulted in a fractured theoretical landscape, lacking a unitary framework. While prior theories of anxiety describe the cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions of anxiety, a unified theory is lacking. Here, we point out that postulates derived from the Free Energy Principle (FEP) may allow for a unified theory to emerge. We argue an approach focused on predictive modelling may afford opportunities to re-conceptualize anxiety within the framework of working generative models, rather than static beliefs. We suggest that a biological system—having had persistent uncertainty in its past—will form posteriors in line with uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether that uncertainty is real. After discussing the FEP, we explain how anxiety develops through learning uncertainty before suggesting predictions for how the model can be tested.",

Imitation Learning (IL) can learn from expert demonstrations without exploration, but it never exceeds the expert's performance and is also vulnerable to distributional shift between demonstration and execution. In this paper, we radically unify RL and IL based on Free Energy Principle (FEP). FEP is a unified Bayesian theory of the brain that explains perception, action and model learning by a common fundamental principle. We present a theoretical extension of FEP and derive an algorithm in which an agent learns the world model that internalizes expert demonstrations and at the same time uses the model to infer the current and future states and actions that maximize rewards. The algorithm thus reduces exploration costs by partially imitating experts as well as maximizing its return in a seamless way, resulting in a higher performance than the suboptimal expert. Our experimental results show that this approach is promising in visual control tasks especially in sparse-reward environments.",

This paper argues that true affective computation requires a shift from neuron-centric, data-driven models to a unified neuro-glial framework governed by first principles of biophysics and information theory. We propose a comprehensive model grounded in the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which posits that any self-organizing system, including the brain, must act to minimize prediction error or 'surprise'. Within this framework, we derive novel mathematical models for the distinct computational roles of glial cells, which constitute over half the cells in the human brain. We formalize astrocytes as regulators of synaptic precision, dynamically tuning the confidence in sensory evidence through calcium-dependent signaling. Microglia are modeled as agents of Bayesian model selection, optimizing the network's structure by pruning synapses that fail to contribute to long-term free energy minimization. Oligodendrocytes are shown to optimize the temporal priors of the brain's generative model by adaptively tuning axonal conduction delays through myelin plasticity. These functions are integrated into a unified, multi-timescale architecture based on a dynamic, heterogeneous graph neural network. In this model, affect is not a programmed output but an emergent property of the system's ongoing inference about the causes of salient interoceptive and exteroceptive states. Affective valence is cast as the rate of change of free energy, while arousal corresponds to the system's overall uncertainty. This work provides a biophysically grounded and mathematically explicit blueprint for a new generation of AI capable of a deeper, more generative form of emotional intelligence.",

    "year": 2015,
    "abstract": "Blind source separation is the computation underlying the cocktail party effect––a partygoer can distinguish a particular talker’s voice from the ambient noise. Early studies indicated that the brain might use blind source separation as a signal processing strategy for sensory perception and numerous mathematical models have been proposed; however, it remains unclear how the neural networks extract particular sources from a complex mixture of inputs. We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation. Moreover, the neural network structures changed to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free-energy principle, a candidate unified theory of learning and memory, and by Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy. This implicit learning can only be explained by some form of Hebbian plasticity. These results are the first in vitro (as opposed to in silico) demonstration of neural networks performing blind source separation, and the first formal demonstration of neuronal self-organization under the free energy principle.",

    "title": "Minimal self-models and the free energy principle",
    "year": 2013,
    "abstract": "The term “minimal phenomenal selfhood” (MPS) describes the basic, pre-reflective experience of being a self (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005a; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of MPS (Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP; Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function built upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of MPS can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the FEP and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.",

    "title": "Improved Alchemical Free Energy Calculations with Optimized Smoothstep Softcore Potentials.",
    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Progress in the development of GPU-accelerated free energy simulation software has enabled practical applications on complex biological systems and fueled efforts to develop more accurate and robust predictive methods. In particular, this work re-examines concerted (a.k.a., one-step or unified) alchemical transformations commonly used in the prediction of hydration and relative binding free energies (RBFEs). We first classify several known challenges in these calculations into three categories: endpoint catastrophes, particle collapse, and large gradient-jumps. While endpoint catastrophes have long been addressed using softcore potentials, the remaining two problems occur much more sporadically and can result in either numerical instability (i.e. complete failure of a simulation) or inconsistent estimation (i.e. stochastic convergence to an incorrect result). The particle collapse problem stems from an imbalance in short-range electrostatic and repulsive interactions and can, in principle, be solved by appropriately balancing the respective softcore parameters. However, the large gradient-jump problem itself arises from the sensitivity of the free energy to large values of the softcore parameters, as might be used in trying to solve the particle collapse issue. Often no satisfactory compromise exists with the existing softcore potential form. As a framework for solving these problems, we developed a new family of smoothstep softcore (SSC) potentials motivated by an analysis of the derivatives along the alchemical path. The smoothstep polynomials generalize the monomial functions that are used in most implementations and provide an additional path-dependent smoothing parameter. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on simple, yet pathological cases that illustrate the three problems outlined. With appropriate parameter selection we find that a second-order SSC(2) potential does at least as well as the conventional approach and provides a vast improvement in terms of consistency across all cases. Lastly, we compare the concerted SSC(2) approach against the gold-standard stepwise (a.k.a., decoupled or multi-step) scheme over a large set of RBFE calculations as might be encountered in drug discovery.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The effects of ligand binding on biomolecular conformation are crucial in drug design, enzyme mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression, and other biological processes. Descriptive models such as “lock and key”, “induced fit”, and “conformation selection” are common ways to interpret such interactions. Another historical model, linked equilibria, proposes that the free‐energy landscape (FEL) is perturbed by the addition of ligand binding energy for the bound population of biomolecules. This principle leads to a unified, quantitative theory of ligand‐induced conformation change, building upon the FEL concept. We call the map of binding free energy over biomolecular conformational space the “binding affinity landscape” (BAL). The perturbed FEL predicts/explains ligand‐induced conformational changes conforming to all common descriptive models. We review recent experimental and computational studies that exemplify the perturbed FEL, with emphasis on RNA. This way of understanding ligand‐induced conformation dynamics motivates new experimental and theoretical approaches to ligand design, structural biology and systems biology.",

A further optimization in regard to boundary distributions under forces is implemented and established on the least absorbed energy principle. High agreement is observed between the analytical results and the FEM results, verifying the correctness of the derivations. Complete comparisons between the analytical and the numerical results indicate the Galerkin method is beneficial when slender ratio is larger than 30, in which the continuity of the deformation is proved to be a crucial influencing factor. A modified numerical strategy about optimal boundary is employed and the remarks imply the algorithm can be availably used to reduce the energy absorption of the whole system.",

Meanwhile, elastic boundary conditions composed of an array of springs are introduced, and the displacement variables and external potential energy of the beam are expressed as wave functions. By using the method of reverberation-ray matrix to integrate and solve the governing equations, a search algorithm based on golden-section search is introduced to calculate the required frequency parameters. A series of numerical results are compared with those reported in literature studies and obtained by simulation software to verify the correctness and versatility of the search algorithm. In addition, three parametric research cases are proposed to investigate the frequency parameters of sandwich piezoelectric beams with elastic restraint conditions, material parameters, thickness ratio, different temperature rises, and external electric potential.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "Despite the mass of empirical data in neuroscience and plenty of interdisciplinary approaches in cognitive science, there are relatively few applicable theories of how the brain as a coherent system functions in terms of energy and entropy processes. Recently, a free energy principle has been portrayed as a possible way towards a unified brain theory. However, its capacity, using free energy and entropy, to unify different perspectives on brain function dynamics is yet to be established. This multidisciplinary study attempts to make sense of the free energy and entropy not only from the perspective of Helmholtz thermodynamic basic principles but also from the information theory framework. Based on the proposed conceptual framework, we constructed (i) four basic brain states (deep sleep, resting, active wakeful and thinking) as dynamic entropy and free energy processes and (ii) stylized a self-organizing mechanism of transitions between the basic brain states during a day period. Adaptive transitions between brain states represent homeostatic rhythms, which produce complex daily brain states dynamics. As a result, the proposed simulation model produces different self-organized circadian dynamics of brain states for different types of chronotypes, which corresponds with the empirical observations.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian model reduction provides an efficient approach for comparing the performance of all nested sub-models of a model, without re-evaluating any of these sub-models. Until now, Bayesian model reduction has been applied mainly in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the signal processing community. The proposed approach has a clear stopping criterion and minimizes the same objective that is used during training. Next to these benefits, our experiments indicate better model performance in comparison to state-of-the-art pruning schemes.",

Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking. This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations, providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.",

In high dimensions, the common approach of minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence from the posterior distribution, or maximizing an evidence lower bound, may deviate from the true posterior mean and underestimate posterior uncertainty. We study instead minimization of the TAP free energy, showing in a high-dimensional asymptotic framework that it has a local minimizer which provides a consistent estimate of the posterior marginals and may be used for correctly calibrated posterior inference. Geometrically, we show that the landscape of the TAP free energy is strongly convex in an extensive neighborhood of this local minimizer, which under certain general conditions can be found by an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm. We then exhibit an efficient algorithm that linearly converges to the minimizer within this local neighborhood. In settings where it is conjectured that no efficient algorithm can find this local neighborhood, we prove analogous geometric properties for a local minimizer of the TAP free energy reachable by AMP, and show that posterior inference based on this minimizer remains correctly calibrated.",

    "title": "Unifying Message Passing Algorithms Under the Framework of Constrained Bethe Free Energy Minimization",
    "year": 2017,
    "abstract": "Variational message passing (VMP), belief propagation (BP) and expectation propagation (EP) have found their wide applications in complex statistical signal processing problems. In addition to viewing them as a class of algorithms operating on graphical models, this article unifies them under an optimization framework, namely, Bethe free energy minimization with differently and appropriately imposed constraints. This new perspective in terms of constraint manipulation can offer additional insights on the connection between different message passing algorithms and is valid for a generic statistical model. It also founds a theoretical framework to systematically derive message passing variants. Taking the sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem as an example, a low-complexity EP variant can be obtained by simple constraint reformulation, delivering better estimation performance with lower complexity than the standard EP algorithm. Furthermore, we can resort to the framework for the systematic derivation of hybrid message passing for complex inference tasks. Notably, a hybrid message passing algorithm is exemplarily derived for joint SSR and statistical model learning with near-optimal inference performance and scalable complexity.",

    "year": 2013,
    "abstract": "This paper reviews recent developments under the free energy principle that introduce a normative perspective on classical economic (utilitarian) decision-making based on (active) Bayesian inference. It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems—like ourselves—try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed “exploitation”) and visiting a number of different goal-states (“exploration”). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "We study mean-field variational Bayesian inference using the TAP approach, for Z2-synchronization as a prototypical example of a high-dimensional Bayesian model. We show that for any signal strength $\\lambda>1$ (the weak-recovery threshold), there exists a unique local minimizer of the TAP free energy functional near the mean of the Bayes posterior law. Furthermore, the TAP free energy in a local neighborhood of this minimizer is strongly convex. Consequently, a natural-gradient/mirror-descent algorithm achieves linear convergence to this minimizer from a local initialization, which may be obtained by a constant number of iterates of Approximate Message Passing (AMP). This provides a rigorous foundation for variational inference in high dimensions via minimization of the TAP free energy. We also analyze the finite-sample convergence of AMP, showing that AMP is asymptotically stable at the TAP minimizer for any $\\lambda>1$, and is linearly convergent to this minimizer from a spectral initialization for sufficiently large $\\lambda$. Such a guarantee is stronger than results obtainable by state evolution analyses, which only describe a fixed number of AMP iterations in the infinite-sample limit. Our proofs combine the Kac-Rice formula and Sudakov-Fernique Gaussian comparison inequality to analyze the complexity of critical points that satisfy strong convexity and stability conditions within their local neighborhoods.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The expected free energy (EFE) is a central quantity in the theory of active inference. It is the quantity that all active inference agents are mandated to minimize through action, and its decomposition into extrinsic and intrinsic value terms is key to the balance of exploration and exploitation that active inference agents evince. Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the variational free energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this letter, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply ”the free energy in the future.” We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE but actively discourages exploratory behavior, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then develop a novel objective, the free energy of the expected future (FEEF), which possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE and an intuitive mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.",

    "abstract": "The brain attenuates its responses to self-produced exteroceptions (e.g., we cannot tickle ourselves). Is this phenomenon, known as sensory attenuation, enabled innately, or acquired through learning? Here, our simulation study using a multimodal hierarchical recurrent neural network model, based on variational free-energy minimization, shows that a mechanism for sensory attenuation can develop through learning of two distinct types of sensorimotor experience, involving self-produced or externally produced exteroceptions. For each sensorimotor context, a particular free-energy state emerged through interaction between top-down prediction with precision and bottom-up sensory prediction error from each sensory area. The executive area in the network served as an information hub. Consequently, shifts between the two sensorimotor contexts triggered transitions from one free-energy state to another in the network via executive control, which caused shifts between attenuating and amplifying prediction-error-induced responses in the sensory areas. This study situates emergence of sensory attenuation (or self-other distinction) in development of distinct free-energy states in the dynamic hierarchical neural system.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "We describe an efficient method for the simultaneous solution of all free energies within a relative binding free-energy (RBFE) network with cycle closure and experimental/reference constraint conditions using Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) and Multistate BAR (MBAR) analysis. Rather than solving the BAR or MBAR equations for each transformation independently, the simultaneous solution of all transformations are obtained by performing a constrained minimization of a global objective function. The nonlinear optimization of the objective function is subjected to affine linear constraints that couple the free energies between the network edges. The constraints are used to enforce the closure of thermodynamic cycles within the RBFE network, and to enforce an additional set of linear constraint conditions demonstrated here to be subsets of (1 or 2) experimental values. We describe details of the practical implementation of the network BAR/MBAR procedure, including use of generalized coordinates in the minimization of the free-energy objective function, propagation of bootstrap errors from those coordinates, and performance and memory optimization. In some cases it is found that use of restraints in the optimization is more practical than use of generalized coordinates for enforcing constraint conditions. The fast BARnet and MBARnet methods are used to analyze the RBFEs of six prototypical protein-ligand systems, and it is shown that enforcement of cycle closure conditions reduces the error in the predictions only modestly, and further reduction in errors can be achieved when one or two experimental RBFEs are included in the optimization procedure. These methods have been implemented into FE-ToolKit, a new free-energy analysis toolkit. The BARnet/MBARnet framework presented here opens the door to new, more efficient and robust free-energy analysis with enhanced predictive capability for drug discovery applications.",

This model generalizes partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalization group. The ensuing renormalizing generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologs of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalized coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits: that is, events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning, and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Active inference offers a unified framework in which agents can exhibit both goal-directed and epistemic behaviors. However, implementing policy search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces presents challenges in terms of scalability and stability. Our previously proposed model, T-GLean, addressed this issue by enabling efficient goal-directed planning through low-dimensional latent space search, further reduced by conditioning on prior habituated behavior. However, the lack of an epistemic term in minimizing expected free energy limited the agent’s ability to engage in information-seeking behavior that can be critical for attaining preferred outcomes. In this study, we present EFE-GLean, an extended version of T-GLean that overcomes this limitation by integrating epistemic value into the planning process. EFE-GLean generates goal-directed policies by inferring low-dimensional future posterior trajectories while maximizing expected information gain. Simulation experiments using an extended T-maze task—implemented in both discrete and continuous domains—demonstrate that the agent can successfully achieve its goals by exploiting hidden environmental information. Furthermore, we show that the agent is capable of adapting to abrupt environmental changes by dynamically revising plans through simultaneous minimization of past variational free energy and future expected free energy. Finally, analytical evaluations detail the underlying mechanisms and computational properties of the model.",

    "abstract": "Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences.

We present a biologically inspired, Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning (AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable, self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at https://github.com/decide-ugent/AIMAPP.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This paper describes a discrete state-space model -- and accompanying methods -- for generative modelling. This model generalises partially observed Markov decision processes to include paths as latent variables, rendering it suitable for active inference and learning in a dynamic setting. Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.",

Furthermore, we also introduce a mixed model that navigates the data complexity trade-off between these strategies, leveraging the strengths of both to facilitate balanced decision-making.

    "abstract": "In nature, active inference agents must learn how observations of the world represent the state of the agent. In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.",

While they were originally developed to model many-body quantum systems, their usage has expanded into the field of machine learning. This work adds to the growing range of applications by focusing on planning by combining the generative modeling capabilities of matrix product states and the action selection algorithm provided by active inference. Their ability to deal with the curse of dimensionality, to represent probability distributions, and to dynamically discover hidden variables make matrix product states specifically an interesting choice to use as the generative model in active inference, which relies on ‘beliefs’ about hidden states within an environment. We evaluate our method on the T-maze and Frozen Lake environments, and show that the TN-based agent acts Bayes optimally as expected under active inference.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This letter proposes a motion planning strategy for a robot to safely interact with humans exhibiting uncertain actions. The human actions are often encoded by the internal states that are attributed to human characteristics and rationality. First, by leveraging a continuous level of rationality, we compute the belief on human rationality along with his/her characteristic. This systematically reasons out the uncertainty in the observed human action, thereby better assessing the potential safety risks during the interaction. Second, based on the computed belief over the human internal states, we formulate a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) problem to plan the robot's actions such that it safely achieves its goal while also actively inferring on the human internal state. To cope with the expensive computation of the SMPC, we develop a sampling-based technique that efficiently evaluates the robot's action conditioned on human uncertainty. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed strategy excels in human action prediction, and significantly improves the safety and efficiency of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).",

    "abstract": "Reactive planning enables the robots to deal with dynamic events in uncertain environments. However, existing methods heavily rely on the predefined hard-coded robot behaviors, e.g, a pre-coded temporal logic formula that specifies how robot should react. Little attention has been paid for autonomous generation of reactive tasks specifications during the runtime. As a first attempt towards this goal, this work develops a real-time decision-making and motion planning framework. It allows the robot to follow a global task planned offline while taking proactive decisions and generating temporal logic specifications for local reactive tasks when encountering dynamic events. Specifically, inspired by the causal knowledge graph, a proposition graph is developed, based on which the decision module encode the environment and the task as the Boolean logic and linear temporal logic (LTL), respectively. Based on the established proposition graph and perceived environment, the agent can autonomously generate an LTL formula to realize the local temporary task. A joint sampling algorithm is then developed, in which the automaton states of local and global task are jointly considered to generate a feasible planning that satisfies both global and local tasks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making and motion planning.",

In this work, we propose a method for reactive TAMP to cope with runtime uncertainties and disturbances. We combine an Active Inference planner (AIP) for adaptive high-level action selection and a novel Multi-Modal Model Predictive Path Integral controller (M3P2I) for low-level control. This results in a scheme that simultaneously adapts both high-level actions and low-level motions. The AIP generates alternative symbolic plans, each linked to a cost function for M3P2I. The latter employs a physics simulator for diverse trajectory rollouts, deriving optimal control by weighing the different samples according to their cost. This idea enables blending different robot skills for fluid and reactive plan execution, accommodating plan adjustments at both the high and low levels to cope, for instance, with dynamic obstacles or disturbances that invalidate the current plan. We have tested our approach in simulations and real-world scenarios.",

Although significant progress has been made in each of these areas independently, the best way to integrate them is an open research question. In this paper, we propose the integration of a statistical model of cognitive map formation within an active inference agent that supports planning under uncertainty. Specifically, we examine the clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) model of cognitive map formation and compare a naive clone graph agent with an active inference-driven clone graph agent, in three spatial navigation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that while both agents are effective in simple scenarios, the active inference agent is more effective when planning in challenging scenarios, in which sensory observations provide ambiguous information about location.",

    "abstract": "Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations is an exceptional approach to reinforce terrestrial infrastructure owing to their remarkable flexibility and superior agility. However, it is essential to design their flight trajectory effectively to make the most of UAV-assisted wireless communications. This paper presents a novel method for improving wireless connectivity between UAVs and terrestrial users through effective path planning. This is achieved by developing a goal-directed trajectory planning method using active inference. First, we create a global dictionary using traveling salesman problem with profits (TSPWP) instances executed on various training examples. This dictionary represents the world model and contains letters representing available hotspots, tokens representing local paths, and words depicting complete trajectories and hotspot order. By using this world model, the UAV can understand the TSPWP’s decision-making grammar and how to use the available letters to form tokens and words at various levels of abstraction and time scales. With this knowledge, the UAV can assess encountered situations and deduce optimal routes based on the belief encoded in the world model. Our proposed method outperforms traditional Q-learning by providing fast, stable, and reliable solutions with good generalization ability.",

    "abstract": "This review systematically explores the potential of the active inference framework in illuminating the cognitive mechanisms of decision-making in repeated games. Repeated games, characterized by multi-round interactions and social uncertainty, closely resemble real-world social scenarios in which the decision-making process involves interconnected cognitive components such as inference, policy selection, and learning. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning models, active inference, grounded in the principle of free energy minimization, unifies perception, learning, planning, and action within a single generative model. Belief updating occurs by minimizing variational free energy, while the exploration–exploitation dilemma is balanced by minimizing expected free energy. Based on partially observable Markov decision processes, the framework naturally incorporates social uncertainty, and its hierarchical structure allows for simulating mentalizing processes, providing a unified account of social decision-making. Future research can further validate its effectiveness through model simulations and behavioral fitting.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.",

This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a'three-ball'paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and'aha moments'via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.",

A wind turbine is electric power equipment that converts wind energy into mechanical power, which drives the rotor to rotate and finally outputs alternating current. The working principle of the wind generator is that the wind wheel rotates under the action of the wind and converts the kinetic energy of the wind into the mechanical energy of the wind wheel shaft. The generator rotates under the drive of the wind wheel shaft to generate electricity. This paper will focus on the structure of the active wind system, including the direction of wind direction detector, impeller controller, generator blade structure, location of different areas, and the prediction of wind speed by using artificial intelligence technology as well as the selection of batteries and the optimization of grid connection technology.

This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages the expressive power of diffusion models to estimate free energy quickly and efficiently. Our approach, merging concepts from statistical physics, machine learning, and computational neuroscience, aims to improve the estimation of posterior distributions. We establish a theoretical link between active inference and diffusion models, emphasizing their shared strategies for uncertainty management, action selection, and model optimization. We propose using diffusion processes to approximate environmental generative models and employ score-based guidance for action selection through expected free-energy minimization. Simulations in increasingly complex grid world environments demonstrate the framework's ability to handle partial observability and stochastic transitions, showing enhanced goal-directed behavior and uncertainty resolution compared to traditional methods. This suggests a path toward scalable active inference agents that could reason about uncertainty in real-world contexts, with possible applications to robotics, healthcare, and adaptive control systems.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Abstract Active inference is a theory of perception, learning, and decision making that can be applied to neuroscience, robotics, psychology, and machine learning. Recently, intensive research has been taking place to scale up this framework using Monte Carlo tree search and deep learning. The goal of this activity is to solve more complicated tasks using deep active inference. First, we review the existing literature and then progressively build a deep active inference agent as follows: we (1) implement a variational autoencoder (VAE), (2) implement a deep hidden Markov model (HMM), and (3) implement a deep critical hidden Markov model (CHMM). For the CHMM, we implemented two versions, one minimizing expected free energy, CHMM[EFE] and one maximizing rewards, CHMM[reward]. Then we experimented with three different action selection strategies: the ε-greedy algorithm as well as softmax and best action selection. According to our experiments, the models able to solve the dSprites environment are the ones that maximize rewards. On further inspection, we found that the CHMM minimizing expected free energy almost always picks the same action, which makes it unable to solve the dSprites environment. In contrast, the CHMM maximizing reward keeps on selecting all the actions, enabling it to successfully solve the task. The only difference between those two CHMMs is the epistemic value, which aims to make the outputs of the transition and encoder networks as close as possible. Thus, the CHMM minimizing expected free energy repeatedly picks a single action and becomes an expert at predicting the future when selecting this action. This effectively makes the KL divergence between the output of the transition and encoder networks small. Additionally, when selecting the action down the average reward is zero, while for all the other actions, the expected reward will be negative. Therefore, if the CHMM has to stick to a single action to keep the KL divergence small, then the action down is the most rewarding. We also show in simulation that the epistemic value used in deep active inference can behave degenerately and in certain circumstances effectively lose, rather than gain, information. As the agent minimizing EFE is not able to explore its environment, the appropriate formulation of the epistemic value in deep active inference remains an open question.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Abstract What is it about our current digital technologies that seemingly makes it difficult for users to attend to what matters to them? According to the dominant narrative in the literature on the “attention economy,” a user’s lack of attention is due to the large amounts of information available in their everyday environments. I will argue that information-abundance fails to account for some of the central manifestations of distraction, such as sudden urges to check a particular information-source in the absence of perceptual information. I will use active inference, and in particular models of action selection based on the minimization of expected free energy, to develop an alternative answer to the question about what makes it difficult to attend. Besides obvious adversarial forms of inference, in which algorithms build up models of users in order to keep them scrolling, I will show that active inference provides the tools to identify a number of problematic structural features of current digital technologies: they contain limitless sources of novelty, they can be navigated by very simple and effortless motor movements, and they offer their action possibilities everywhere and anytime independent of place or context. Moreover, recent models of motivated control show an intricate interplay between motivation and control that can explain sudden transitions in motivational state and the consequent alteration of the salience of actions. I conclude, therefore, that the challenges users encounter when engaging with digital technologies are less about information overload or inviting content, but more about the continuous availability of easily available possibilities for action.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "In autonomous robotic decision-making under uncertainty, the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration of available options must be considered. If secondary information associated with options can be utilized, such decision-making problems can often be formulated as contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). In this study, we apply active inference, which has been actively studied in the field of neuroscience in recent years, as an alternative action selection strategy for CMABs. Unlike conventional action selection strategies, it is possible to rigorously evaluate the uncertainty of each option when calculating the expected free energy (EFE) associated with the decision agent's probabilistic model, as derived from the free-energy principle. We specifically address the case where a categorical observation likelihood function is used, such that EFE values are analytically intractable. We introduce new approximation methods for computing the EFE based on variational and Laplace approximations. Extensive simulation study results demonstrate that, compared to other strategies, active inference generally requires far fewer iterations to identify optimal options and generally achieves superior cumulative regret, for relatively low extra computational cost.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "In the free energy principle (FEP), proposed by Friston, it is supposed that agents seek to minimize the “surprise”–the negative log (marginal) likelihood of observations (i.e., sensory stimuli)–given the agents' current belief. This is achieved by minimizing the free energy, which provides an upper bound on the surprise. The FEP has been applied to action selection in a framework called “active inference,” where agents are supposed to select an action so that they minimize the “expected free energy” (EFE). While the FEP and active inference have attracted the attention of researchers in a wide range of fields such as psychology and psychiatry, as well as neuroscience, it is not clear which psychological construct EFE is related to. To facilitate the discussion and interpretation of psychological processes underlying active inference, we introduce a computational component termed the “retrospective (or residual) surprise,” which is the surprise of an observation after updating the belief given the observation itself. We show that the predicted retrospective surprise (PRS) provides a lower bound on EFE: EFE is always larger than PRS. We illustrate the properties of EFE and PRS using examples of inference for a binary hidden cause given a binary observation. Essentially, EFE and PRS show similar behavior; however, in certain situations, they provide different predictions regarding action selection. This study also provides insights into the mechanism of active inference based on EFE.",

We used a game-like experimental setup to directly compare the roles of sensory and affective action effects in selecting and performing reaching actions in forced- and free-choice tasks. The two kinds of action effects did not interact. Action selection and execution in the forced-choice task were strongly impacted by the spatial compatibility between actions and the expected sensory action effects, whereas the free-choice task was hardly affected. In contrast, action execution, but not selection, in both tasks was strongly impacted by the spatial compatibility between actions and highly valued action effects. This pattern suggests that sensory and affective action effects serve different purposes: The former seem to dominate rule-based action selection, whereas the latter might serve to reduce any remaining action uncertainty.",

The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \\frac{2}{ \\pi} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $\\zeta$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.",

    "abstract": "Depressive, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders have many symptoms in common such as unstable mood, high anxiety, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration among others. This degeneracy creates ambiguity in classifying psychiatric disorders and raises the question of their categorical vs. dimensional nature. Consequently, such ambiguity presents a dilemma for choosing diagnosis-specific vs. trans-diagnostic therapies. In this paper, I build on a theory that considers affective disorders on the continuum of stress response from normative to traumatic. Using an integrative evolutionary-stress response-predictive processing (iESP) model, I arrange affective disorders on a continuum of precision-weighting dysregulation, where depressive, anxiety and trauma-induced disorders have a characteristic pattern of precision-weighting dysregulation. I specifically address the relationship between anxiety and depressive stress responses, exploring the role of anxiety in the dynamics of depressive stress response and the resulting high co-occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms. Finally, I discuss the model's relevance for therapy of depression.",

    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over the last decade or so, several researchers have considered the predictive processing framework (PPF) to be a useful perspective from which to shed some much-needed light on the mechanisms behind psychosis. Most approaches to psychosis within PPF come down to the idea of the “atypical” brain generating inaccurate hypotheses that the “typical” brain does not generate, either due to a systematic top-down processing bias or more general precision weighting breakdown. Strong at explaining common individual symptoms of psychosis, such approaches face some issues when we look at a more general clinical picture. In this paper, we propose an update on the current accounts of psychosis based on the realization that a neurotypical brain constantly generates non-actual, de-coupled, counterfactual hypotheses as part of healthy cognition. We suggest that what is going on in psychosis, at least in some cases, is not so much a generation of erroneous hypotheses, but rather an inability to correctly use the counterfactual ones. This updated view casts “accurate” cognition as more fragile and delicate, but also closes the gap between psychosis and typical cognition.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Abstract Predictive Processing accounts of autism claim that autistic individuals assign higher precision to their prediction errors than non‐autistic individuals, that is, autistic individuals update their predictions more readily when faced with unexpected sensory input. Since setting the level of precision is a fundamental part of perception and learning, we propose that such differences should be detectable in various domains at a very early age, before clinical symptoms have fully emerged.

We used a novel implicit learning paradigm to examine the effect of sensory noise on the predictions participants built.

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "Interoceptive-exteroceptive integration is fundamental for a unified interactive experience of the world with the body. Predictive coding accounts propose that these integrated signals operate predictively, with regulation by precision-weighting. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) are one means to investigate integrated processing. In a previous study, consistent with predictive coding characterisations of precision-weighting, we observed modulation of HEPs by attention. However, we found no evidence of HEP modulation by participants’ interoceptive ability, despite the characterisation by predictive coding theories of trait abilities as a similar reflection of differential precision-weighting. In this study, we sought to more sensitively test the hypothesised trait-precision influences on HEPs by using an individually-adjusted measure of interoceptive performance. However, contrary to a precision-weighted predictive coding framework, we failed to find evidence in support of the HEP modulations by attentional-precision or trait-precision. Nonetheless, we observed robust HEP effects indicative of an expectation of a sound on the basis of a heartbeat -i.e. interoceptive-exteroceptive integration. It is possible that under our more individually-tailored task, participants relied less on attentional-precision to ‘boost’ predictions due to an enhanced perception of cardio-audio synchrony. Furthermore, assessing interoceptive ability is challenging, thus variations in performance may not accurately reflect trait-precision variations. Nevertheless, in sum, our findings are inconsistent with a precision-weighted prediction error view of the HEP, and highlight the need for clearer definitions of the manipulation and measurement of precision in predictive coding. Finally, our robust interoceptive-exteroceptive integration HEP effects may provide a valuable tool for investigating such integration in both clinical conditions and cognition. Impact statement We investigate heart-evoked potentials during interoceptive-exteroceptive integration to determine whether cross-modal integrated processes operate under a precision-weighted predictive coding framework. Using a more sensitive individually-tailored task, we found no evidence of the modulation of cardio-audio expectation by attention or individual differences in interoceptive perception (i.e. by state or trait measures of precision). Nonetheless, we replicate evidence of cardiac-driven predictions of auditory stimuli, providing a potential tool for investigating their relationship with emotion and embodied selfhood.",

    "year": 2018,
    "abstract": "In the predictive coding view of perception, the context-sensitive filtering of incoming sensations is achieved through the precision weighting (PW) of sensory prediction errors (PE). We aimed at seeking empirical evidence for this context-dependent, adaptive computational process and the respective neurophysiological encoding of PW and PE during passive listening. We hypothesized that the implicit learning of contextual (second-order) regularities would exert a top-down influence onto (first-order) sensory processing. We therefore manipulated the predictability of oddball sequences. Using learning models and dynamic causal models (DCM) of effective connectivity, we reveal the trial-to-trial dynamics of perceptual learning and its implementation within a fronto-temporal network. Essentially, we show an implicit adaptation of perceptual learning to the informational content of the environment. Under predictability, it translates into a larger information integration leading to an increased learning rate (PW), associated with a decreased neuronal self-inhibition, and a decreased (precision-weighted) PE, conveyed by decreased forward connectivity. Highlights Hierarchical perceptual learning was studied with simultaneous EEG and MEG during passive listening of auditory oddball sequences. Neuro-computational modeling confirmed perceptual learning deploying within a fronto-temporal network. An implicit and computationally efficient adaptation of perceptual learning to the informational content of the sound sequence was revealed. Larger information relevance yielded a larger information integration in perceptual learning. The context-dependent tuning of sensory prediction errors was associated to cortical inhibitory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Cognitive functions play a vital role in how tasks are performed; for this, temporary cognitive and mental dysfunctions could lead to grave consequences, especially when an accurate and prompt response is required. Attention and reaction time to noise are among the most effective exogenous factors on the brain processing mechanism. This study aimed to measure the sustained attention of workers in the steel industry exposed to different sound pressure levels. \nMaterial and Methods: The study was conducted in 4 general stages, including 1- Selecting predictive orientation variables (age, work history, different sound pressure levels); 2- Conducting the Cognitive Performance Test (CPT); 3 Conducting N-BACK Cognitive Performance Test and 4- Modeling cognitive performance changes using model precision methods. \nResults: Continuous Performance Test (CPT) results indicated that all three groups’ omission error, commission error, and response time were affected by shift time. All three components increased significantly as the shift ended, decreasing individuals’ cognitive function. Also, the higher noise impact in modeling CPT and N-Back tests indicated reduced workers’ concentration. \nConclusion: These study findings suggested that greater noise weight obtained in test modeling in threetime intervals, i.e., in the beginning, middle, and end of the shift, affected the continuous performance components of the CPT and working memory performance of the N-back test, including workers’ response time and reaction time, with workers’ rate of error increasing and their focus decreasing during the shift.",

To address this issue, this paper introduces a Linear Model Predictive Controller (GP‐SOMPC) based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Snake Optimizer (SO) to achieve high‐performance trajectory tracking control under large curvatures through learning. This algorithm adopts a two‐degree‐of‐freedom vehicle dynamics model and models disturbances and unmodeled dynamics as Gaussian Processes (GP) using collected experimental data. Additionally, an Adaptive Weighting Coefficient Model Predictive Controller based on the Snake Optimizer (SO) method is presented to improve the poor adaptation of vehicle trajectory tracking accuracy according to reference path curvature under fixed weighting coefficients in traditional Model Predictive Control (MPC), which results in inadequate trajectory tracking precision. The simulation experiments have verified that the proposed GP‐SOMPC algorithm can enhance trajectory tracking precision under high‐speed, large curvature conditions and exhibits good adaptability to variations in path curvature.",

    "abstract": "Predictive processing frameworks have demonstrated the central role that prediction plays in a range of cognitive processes including bottom-up and top-down mechanisms of attention control. However, relatively little is understood about how predictive processes interact with the third main determinant of attentional priority - selection history. In this experiment, participants developed a history of either color or shape selection while we observed the impact of these histories in an additional singleton search task using behavioral measures and ERP measures of attentional control. Throughout the experiment, participants were encouraged to predict the upcoming display, but prediction errors were either high or low depending on session. Persistent group differences in our results showed that selection history contributes to the precision weighting of a stimulus, and that this is mediated by overall prediction error. Color-singleton distractors captured attention and required greater suppression when participants had a history of color selection; however, these participants gained large benefits when the upcoming stimuli were highly predictable. We suggest that selection history modulates the precision expectations for a feature in a persistent and implicit way, producing an attentional bias that predictability can help to counteract, but cannot prevent or eliminate entirely.",

However, few studies have examined this theory during complex cognitive processing across multiple time-scales and levels of abstraction. We used MEG, EEG and fMRI to ask whether dynamic, hierarchical predictive coding can account for the timecourse of evoked activity at multiple cortical levels during language comprehension. Unexpected words produced increased activity in left temporal cortex (lower-level prediction error). Critically, violations of high-precision event predictions produced additional activity within left inferior frontal cortex (higher-level prediction error). Furthermore, the successful resolution of higher-level prediction error led to later feedback to temporal cortex (top-down sharpening), while a failure to resolve these errors led to sustained activity at still lower levels (reanalysis). These findings suggest that fundamental principles of dynamic hierarchical predictive coding –– suppression of prediction error, precision-weighting, delayed top-down sharpening –– can explain the dynamics of neural activity during human language comprehension.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Abstract The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been widely used to investigate deficits in early auditory information processing, particularly in psychosis. Predictive coding theories suggest that impairments in sensory learning may arise from disturbances in hierarchical message passing, likely due to aberrant precision-weighting of prediction errors (PEs). This study employed a modified auditory oddball paradigm with varying phases of stability and volatility to disentangle the impact of hierarchical PEs on auditory MMN generation in 43 healthy controls (HCs). Single-trial EEG data were modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian model of learning to identify neural correlates of low-level PEs about tones and high-level PEs about environmental volatility. Our analysis revealed a reduced expression of the auditory MMN in volatile compared to stable phases of the paradigm. Additionally, lower Global Functioning (GF): Social scores were associated with a reduced difference waveform at 332 ms after stimulus presentation across the entire MMN paradigm. Further analysis revealed that this association was present during the volatile phase but not the stable phase of the paradigm. Source reconstruction suggested that the association between the stable difference waveform and psychosocial functioning originated in the left superior temporal gyrus. Finally, we found significant EEG signatures of both low- and high-level PEs and precision ratios. Our findings highlight the value of computational models in understanding the neural mechanisms involved in early auditory information processing and their connection to psychosocial functioning.",

Using active inference frameworks, the work shows serotonin modulates the precision of sensory inputs and prior habits, regulating exploratory behavior and environmental sampling.\nRobotics experiments translate these biological insights into artificial systems, demonstrating how precision-based active inference can guide autonomous behavior in humanoid robots through adaptive sensorimotor control and efficient information seeking.\nTheoretical work on attention and body ownership illusions explores precision control in embodied systems. Mathematical modeling of the rubber hand illusion shows how the brain arbitrates between competing sensory models via precision-weighted inference.\nAnalysis of psilocybin's neural effects demonstrates that this serotonergic agent increases chaotic brain responses and neural transition complexity, supporting theories that psychedelics decrease hierarchical neural communication precision through fundamental reorganization of neural dynamics.",

Current photonic convolutional processors transform tensor convolutions into multi-channel general matrix multiplication (GeMM), which follows the path of electronic counterparts, leading to data replication and hardware complexity. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate a photonic tensor processing unit (PTPU) with a single modulator, which offers a more concise approach for multi-channel standard tensor convolution processing, different from the channel-wise convolution method. By executing multi-tensor parallel computing instead of multi-channel parallel computing, PTPU can directly produce feature tensors without clock synchronization and delay compensation between multiple channels and allows more release of physical hardware resources. Furthermore, an integrated array of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are used to be photonic synapses for programmable weight bank, demonstrating record-high precision of 9.2 bits for weights. In the proof-of-concept experiment, we extracted features from a 3-channel (RGB) image in horizontal and vertical directions, using integrated multi-wavelength photonic tensor kernels. We then built a 3D convolutional neural network to predict the presence of COVID-19 based on computer tomography (CT) scan data consisting of 64-channel tensors.",

    "title": "Desire and Motivation in Predictive Processing: An Ecological-Enactive Perspective",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The predictive processing theory refers to a family of theories that take the brain and body of an organism to implement a hierarchically organized predictive model of its environment that works in the service of prediction-error minimization. Several philosophers have wondered how belief-like states of prediction account for the conative role desire plays in motivating a person to act. A compelling response to this challenge has begun to take shape that starts from the idea that certain predictions are prioritized in the predictive processing hierarchy. We use the term “first priors” to refer to such predictions. We will argue that agents use first priors to engage in affective sense-making. What has been missing in the literature that seeks to understand desire in terms of predictive processing is a recognition of the role of affective sense-making in motivating action. We go on to describe how affective sense-making can play a role in the context-sensitive shifting assignments of precision to predictions. Precision expectations refer to estimates of the reliability of predictions of the sensory states that are the consequences of acting. Given the role of affect in modulating precision-estimation, we argue that agents will tend to experience their environment through the lens of their desires as a field of inviting affordances. We will show how PP provides a neurocomputational framework that can bridge between first-person phenomenological descriptions of what it is to be a desiring creature, and a third-person, ecological-enactive analysis of desire.",

    "title": "Transdiagnostic failure to adapt interoceptive precision estimates across affective, substance use, and eating disorders: A replication study",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Recent computational theories of interoception suggest that perception of bodily states rests upon an expected reliability- or precision-weighted integration of afferent signals and prior beliefs. The computational psychiatry framework further suggests that aberrant precision-weighting may lead to misestimation of bodily states, potentially hindering effective visceral regulation and promoting psychopathology. In a previous study, we fit a Bayesian computational model of perception to behavior on a heartbeat tapping task to test whether aberrant precision-weighting was associated with misestimation of bodily states. We found that, during an interoceptive perturbation designed to amplify afferent signal precision (inspiratory breath-holding), healthy individuals increased the precision-weighting assigned to ascending cardiac signals (relative to resting conditions), while individuals with symptoms of anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and/or eating disorders did not. A second study also replicated the pattern observed in healthy participants. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate our prior findings in a new transdiagnostic patient sample (N=285) similar to the one in the original study. These new results successfully replicated those found in our previous study, indicating that, transdiagnostically, patients were unable to adjust beliefs about the reliability of interoceptive signals - preventing the ability to accurately perceive changes in their bodily state. Follow-up analyses combining samples from the previous and current study (N=719) also afforded the power to identify group differences within narrower diagnostic groups and to examine predictive accuracy when logistic regression models were trained on one sample and tested on the other. Given the increased confidence in the generalizability of these effects, future studies should examine the utility of interceptive precision measures in predicting treatment outcomes or identify whether these computational mechanisms might represent novel therapeutic targets for improving visceral regulation.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Computational neuropsychiatry is a leading discipline to explain psychopathology in terms of neuronal message passing, distributed processing, and belief propagation in neuronal networks. Active Inference (AI) has been one of the ways of representing this dysfunctional signal processing. It involves that all neuronal processing and action selection can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence, or minimizing variational free energy. Following these principles, it has been suggest that dysconnection in neuronal network results in aberrant belief updating and erroneous inference, leading to psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. However, there is a classic distinction between disorders of inference (or synaptopathy - including the majority of psychiatric disorders), and disorders of brain function (including vascular neurological pathologies and severe forms of tauopathy and synucleinopathies). This distinction is generally based on the idea that synaptopathies impair neuromodulatory precision weighting, leading to rigid inferences or heightened sensitivity to noise, while disorders of brain function are linked to damage in the nervous system (disconnection). This makes it challenging to apply the logic of the free energy principle. We suggest that this distinction will enable future models of neuropsychiatric symptoms to be improved by considering more than neuronal message passing.",

    "year": 2026,
    "abstract": "Precision psychiatry aspires to elucidate brain-based biomarkers of psychopathology to bolster disease risk assessment and treatment development. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has helped triangulate brain circuits whose functional features are correlated with or even predictive of forms of psychopathology. Yet, fMRI biomarkers to date remain largely descriptive identifiers of where, rather than how, neurobiology is aberrant, limiting their utility for guiding treatment. We present a method for decomposing fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) into constituent biomechanisms - output drive, input responsivity, modulator gating - with clearer alignment to differentiable therapeutic interventions. Neurocircuit mechanism decomposition (NMD) integrates (i) a graph-constrained, lag-aware transformer to estimate directed, pathway-specific routing distributions and drive signals, with (ii) a measurement-aware state-space model (SSM) that models hemodynamic convolution and recovers intrinsic latent dynamics. This dual-head architecture yields interpretable circuit parameters that may provide a more direct bridge from fMRI to treatment strategy selection. We instantiate the model in an anatomically and electrophysiologically well-defined circuit: the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.",

    "title": "Computational psychiatry: from synapses to sentience",
    "year": 2022,
    "abstract": "This review considers computational psychiatry from a particular viewpoint: namely, a commitment to explaining psychopathology in terms of pathophysiology. It rests on the notion of a generative model as underwriting (i) sentient processing in the brain, and (ii) the scientific process in psychiatry. The story starts with a view of the brain—from cognitive and computational neuroscience—as an organ of inference and prediction. This offers a formal description of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks; and how certain kinds of dysconnection lead to aberrant belief updating and false inference. The dysconnections in question can be read as a pernicious synaptopathy that fits comfortably with formal notions of how we—or our brains—encode uncertainty or its complement, precision . It then considers how the ensuing process theories are tested empirically, with an emphasis on the computational modelling of neuronal circuits and synaptic gain control that mediates attentional set, active inference, learning and planning. The opportunities afforded by this sort of modelling are considered in light of in silico experiments; namely, computational neuropsychology, computational phenotyping and the promises of a computational nosology for psychiatry. The resulting survey of computational approaches is not scholarly or exhaustive. Rather, its aim is to review a theoretical narrative that is emerging across subdisciplines within psychiatry and empirical scales of investigation. These range from epilepsy research to neurodegenerative disorders; from post-traumatic stress disorder to the management of chronic pain, from schizophrenia to functional medical symptoms.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Objective This article offers a philosophical thesis for psychiatric disorders that rests upon some simple truths about the mind and brain. Specifically, it asks whether the dual aspect monism—that emerges from sleep research and theoretical neurobiology—can be applied to pathophysiology and psychopathology in psychiatry. Methods Our starting point is that the mind and brain are emergent aspects of the same (neuronal) dynamics; namely, the brain–mind. Our endpoint is that synaptic dysconnection syndromes inherit the same dual aspect; namely, aberrant inference or belief updating on the one hand, and a failure of neuromodulatory synaptic gain control on the other. We start with some basic considerations from sleep research that integrate the phenomenology of dreaming with the neurophysiology of sleep. Results We then leverage this treatment by treating the brain as an organ of inference. Our particular focus is on the role of precision (i.e., the representation of uncertainty) in belief updating and the accompanying synaptic mechanisms. Conclusions Finally, we suggest a dual aspect approach—based upon belief updating (i.e., mind processes) and its neurophysiological implementation (i.e., brain processes)—has a wide explanatory compass for psychiatry and various movement disorders. This approach identifies the kind of pathophysiology that underwrites psychopathology—and points to certain psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological targets, which may stand in mechanistic relation to each other.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In Part I (Muris et al. in Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review 22:549–561, 2025), we provided meta-analytic evidence showing that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or high levels of autistic traits exhibit higher rates of problematic internet use (PIU), but paradoxically have lower levels of social media use compared to typically developing individuals or those with lower levels of autistic traits. The current theoretical article introduces a motivation-based developmental psychopathology model aimed at clarifying the motives behind the atypical internet and social media use observed in people with ASD or with high levels of autistic traits. We argue that excessive online activities, such as gaming and watching videos, can be understood through specific social, coping, and enhancement motives for internet use, which are especially prominent in ASD due to disorder-specific characteristics such as narrow interests and challenges in face-to-face interactions. In contrast, when it comes to social media use, these three motives operate differently, leading individuals with ASD to exhibit lower motivation to engage in online social interactions compared to neurotypical individuals. The current article emphasizes adolescence as a critical developmental period where internet use can easily become maladaptive and explores the role of parents in regulating the online behaviors of young people with ASD. Finally, the clinical implications of the model are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of psychopathology vary across people, limiting inferences about origins and treatments of disorders for any one person. The high-dimensional symptom space (HDSS) model offers a novel framework for understanding psychopathology by representing symptoms as vectors within a multidimensional space. Unlike traditional categorical and dimensional models, HDSS uses geometric distances to empirically characterize a person’s unique experience of symptoms, with the option to integrate social and cultural factors for more precise, personalized treatments. Using data from the adolescent brain and cognitive development (ABCD) study, we demonstrate that HDSS preserves individual specificity, effectively captures dynamic trajectories of psychological distress, and accommodates clinical heterogeneity. Results indicate that HDSS distances correspond to symptom severity and capture nuanced patterns of psychological distress over time, offering a comprehensive and individualized understanding of psychopathology. This model allows for a person-centered understanding of psychopathology, highlighting unique symptom patterns and their evolution over time. HDSS represents a significant advancement in personalized psychological care, providing a data-driven framework for understanding psychopathology symptoms, and implementing effective interventions.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Developmental psychopathology has successfully advanced an understanding of risk and protective factors in multivariate models. However, many areas have relied on top-down approaches that define psychological constructs based largely or solely on their physical form. In this paper, we first describe how top-down approaches have significantly hindered progress by generating generic risk and protective models that yield little more than the conclusion that axiomatically positive and negative factors respectively beget an interchangeable array of positive and negative child sequelae. To advance precision and novelty as central priorities, we describe behavioral systems frameworks rooted in evolutionary theory that infuse both form (i.e., what it looks like) and function (what it is designed to do) into psychological constructs. We further address how this paradigm has generated new growing points for developmental models of interparental relationships and parenting. In the final section, we provide recommendations for expanding this approach to other areas of developmental psychopathology. Throughout the paper, we document how the focus on functional patterns of behavior in well-defined developmental contexts advance precision and novelty in understanding children's response processes to threats, opportunities, and challenges in associations between their developmental histories and their psychological sequelae.",

Second, I outline and demonstrate a systematic process for approaching treatment selection by leveraging precisely characterized representations of psychopathology.

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane proteome resides at the interface between the extra- and intra-cellular environment and through its various roles in signal transduction, immune recognition, nutrient transport, and cell–cell/cell–matrix interactions plays an absolutely critical role in determining the fate of a cell. Our work was aimed at exploring the cell-membrane proteome of a HER2+ breast-cancer cell line (SKBR3) to identify triggers responsible for uncontrolled cell proliferation and intrinsic resources that enable detection and therapeutic interventions. To mimic environmental conditions that enable cancer cells to evolve adaptation/survival traits, cell culture was performed under serum-rich and serum-deprived conditions. Proteomic analysis enabled the identification of ~ 2000 cell-membrane proteins. Classification into proteins with receptor/enzymatic activity, CD antigens, transporters, and cell adhesion/junction proteins uncovered overlapping roles in processes that drive cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, immune response, adhesion and migration, as well as alternate pathways for proliferation. The large number of tumor markers (> 50) and putative drug targets (> 100) exposed a vast potential for yet unexplored detection and targeting opportunities, whereas the presence of 15 antigen immunological markers enabled an assessment of epithelial, mesenchymal or stemness characteristics. Serum-starved cells displayed altered processes related to mitochondrial OXPHOS/ATP synthesis, protein folding and localization, while serum-treated cells exhibited attributes that support tissue invasion and metastasis. Altogether, our findings advance the understanding of the biological triggers that sustain aberrant cancer cell proliferation, survival and development of resistance to therapeutic drugs, and reveal vast innate opportunities for guiding immunological profiling and precision medicine applications aimed at target selection or drug discovery.",

It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the autonomous organization of biological systems. It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.",

We discuss how these issues affect related results involving generalised coordinates and, where appropriate, mention consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences from newer formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that various definitions of the “Markov blanket” proposed in different works are not equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument, which involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We prove by counterexamples that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.",

Formulating a principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergodicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of biological systems. Thus far, however, the physics foundations of the free energy principle have received hardly any attention. Here, we start to fill this gap and analyse some of the challenges raised by applications of statistical physics for modelling biological targets. Based on our analysis, we conclude that model-building grounded in the free energy principle exacerbates a trade-off between generality and realism, because of a fundamental mismatch between its physics assumptions and the properties of actual biological targets.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "A theoretical account of development in mesocortical anatomy is derived from the free energy principle, operating in a neural field with both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian neural plasticity. An elementary structural unit is proposed, in which synaptic connections at mesoscale are arranged in paired patterns with mirror symmetry. Exchanges of synaptic flux in each pattern form coupled spatial eigenmodes, and the line of mirror reflection between the paired patterns operates as a Markov blanket, so that prediction errors in exchanges between the pairs are minimized. The theoretical analysis is then compared to the outcomes from a biological model of neocortical development, in which neuron precursors are selected by apoptosis for cell body and synaptic connections maximizing synchrony and also minimizing axonal length. It is shown that this model results in patterns of connection with the anticipated mirror symmetries, at micro-, meso- and inter-arial scales, among lateral connections, and in cortical depth. This explains the spatial organization and functional significance of neuron response preferences, and is compatible with the structural form of both columnar and noncolumnar cortex. Multi-way interactions of mirrored representations can provide a preliminary anatomically realistic model of cortical information processing.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The free energy principle (FEP), along with the associated constructs of Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the core components of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is, a mathematical theory of ``every'' ``thing''. Here, we leverage the FEP to develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects, object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects, given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment. Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse, the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.",

We also discuss how these errors affect the very similar Friston (2014, this https URL) and, where appropriate, mention consequences for the newer proposals in Friston (2019, arXiv:1906.10184v1 ) and Parr et al. (2019, this https URL). The errors call into question the purported interpretation that the internal coordinates of every system with a Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian inference. In particular, in addition to highlighting the implicit restriction to linear models, we identify three formal errors in the main argument of Friston (2013): The first concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets which turns out not to be generally correct. We prove the non-equivalence with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket but does not satisfy the rewritten equations. Our counterexample also invalidates the corresponding (but more general) rewritten equations in the more recent Friston (2019). The second error concerns the Free Energy Lemma itself, which we prove, by counterexample, to be wrong in general. The third is the claim that the Free Energy Lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is unjustified. Additionally, we highlight that the definitions of the Markov blanket in Friston (2013) and Parr et al. (2019) are not equivalent and that the assumptions in Parr et al.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "This opinion piece proposes that addiction can be conceptualized as a disruption of an agent’s Markov blanket - the statistical boundary separating internal states from the external environment - under active inference. Addiction arises when the Markov blanket becomes overly rigid, assigning excessive precision to a narrow set of sensory inputs and active states associated with the addictive stimulus. This leads to compulsive behaviors aimed at immediate rewards while sacrificing the exploration of flexible action policies that would reduce uncertainty and optimize the agent’s long-term fit with the environment. The addicted agent becomes trapped in a limited behavioral repertoire, unable to adapt to volatility, thus eroding its own resilience. Rigid, compulsive patterns of interaction can propagate outwards, undermining the resilience and sustainability of the wider ecosystem. This perspective offers an integrative framework for understanding addictive disorders and their broader impacts, suggesting interventions aimed at pulling the Markov blanket away from problematic attractors and promoting adaptive exploration.",

    "title": "Setting boundaries: Development of neural and behavioral event cognition in early childhood.",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "The ongoing stream of sensory experience is so complex and ever-changing that we tend to parse this experience at \"event boundaries,\" which structures and strengthens memory. Memory processes undergo profound change across early childhood. Whether young children also divide their ongoing processing along event boundaries, and if those boundaries relate to memory, could provide important insight into the development of memory systems. In Study 1, 4-7-year-old children and adults segmented a cartoon, and we tested their memory. Children's event boundaries were more variable than adults' and differed in location and consistency of agreement. Older children's event segmentation was more adult-like than younger children's, and children who segmented events more like adults had better memory for those events. In Study 2, we asked whether these developmental differences in event segmentation had their roots in distinct neural representations. A separate group of 4-8-year-old children watched the same cartoon while undergoing an fMRI scan. In the right hippocampus, greater pattern dissimilarity across event boundaries compared to within events was evident for both child and adult behavioral boundaries, suggesting children and adults share similar event cognition. However, the boundaries identified by a data-driven Hidden Markov Model found that a different brain region-the left and right angular gyrus-aligned only with event boundaries defined by children. Overall, these data suggest that children's event cognition is reasonably well-developed by age 4 but continues to become more adult-like across early childhood. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Adults naturally break their experience into events, which structures and strengthens memory, but less is known about children's event perception and memory. Study 1 had adults and children segment and remember events from an animated show, and Study 2 compared those segmentations to other children's fMRI data. Children show better recognition and temporal order memory and more adult-like event segmentation with age, and children who segment more like adults have better memory. Children's and adults' behavioral boundaries mapped onto pattern similarity differences in hippocampus, and children's behavioral boundaries matched a data-driven model's boundaries in angular gyrus.",

    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a prevalent neurological condition that can lead to persistent cognitive impairments, disrupting memory, attention, and executive function. In this study, we explore the mechanisms of cognitive decline in mTBI through the lens of Markov blankets—a theoretical framework that delineates the statistical boundary between the brain’s internal and external states. By simulating the impact of mTBI on sensory, active, internal, and external states, we demonstrate how disruptions to the Markov blanket structure contribute to impairments in predictive coding and cognitive processing. Our simulation introduces noise and connectivity reductions that mimic the neurometabolic and synaptic changes following mTBI, revealing delayed sensory processing, impaired motor function, and cognitive instability. These findings highlight the importance of Markov blankets in maintaining cognitive integrity and offer novel insights into the pathophysiology of post-concussion syndrome. Understanding how mTBI disrupts the brain's functional architecture through Markov blanket disturbances may inform more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Robots in uncertain realworld environments must perform both goaldirected and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in robotics and deep learning, the ability of robots to perceive and act remain far below that of humans. To bridge this gap, we utilize active inference, a framework based on the free-energy principle that accounts for various human brain functions. Despite the utility of active inference, most previous studies have focused on simulated or real-world environments with low-dimensional observations. Therefore, direct applications in real-world robotics with high-dimensional observation and action spaces remain a challenge. To address this issue, we combine the active inference framework with contrastive learning and develop an extension by introducing learning from demonstration. This framework comprises a world model, an action model, and an expected free-energy model. The world model ensures an adequate perception of the environment by minimizing contrastive variational free energy. Meanwhile, the expected free-energy model estimates the contrastive expected free energy, while the action model generates adaptive actions by learning from demonstrations, with the aim of minimizing the estimates provided by the expected free-energy model. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework through image-based robotic reaching tasks in both learned and unlearned real-world environments. As a result, while the baselines achieved a success rate of up to approximately 71%, the proposed framework achieved a success rate of around 96%. Moreover, the proposed framework realized performance improvements by leveraging estimated expected free energy for action selection. These results highlight the utility of active inference with contrastive learning and learning from demonstration for real-world robot control.",

    "year": 2021,
    "abstract": "To interact seamlessly with robots, users must infer the causes of a robot's behavior and be confident about that inference. Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). Despite its crucial role, it is largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human interactions with nonhuman artefacts. Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and competence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then introduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In this setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the trustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of active inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model suggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. Finally, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.",

Here, we discuss a proof-of-principle implementation of the active inference scheme for the control or the 7-DoF arm of a (simulated) PR2 robot. By manipulating visual and proprioceptive noise levels, we show under which conditions robot control under the active inference scheme is accurate. Besides accurate control, our analysis of the internal system dynamics (e.g. the dynamics of the hidden states that are inferred during the inference) sheds light on key aspects of the framework such as the quintessentially multimodal nature of control and the differential roles of proprioception and vision. In the discussion, we consider the potential importance of being able to implement active inference in robots. In particular, we briefly review the opportunities for modelling psychophysiological phenomena such as sensory attenuation and related failures of gain control, of the sort seen in Parkinson's disease. We also consider the fundamental difference between active inference and optimal control formulations, showing that in the former the heavy lifting shifts from solving a dynamical inverse problem to creating deep forward or generative models with dynamics, whose attracting sets prescribe desired behaviours.",

Hence, the knowledge of robot-environment interactions needs to be continually updated for system adaptation. It can be implemented through self-verification as a continual comparison of predictions with observations using the predictive coding (PC) principle. The principle has been further extended into the active inference control (AIC) in biomimetic robotics to drive the control, state estimation, and model update. However, continually updating one model leads to catastrophic forgetting in the long term. Therefore, we propose an autonomously expanding self-verifying world model (WM) of sensorimotor dynamics utilized in model-based gait control. The model combines PC with the incremental knowledge representation based on the internal model (IM) principle. The proposed method is experimentally validated in virtual and real scenarios, where the hexapod walking robot has to recognize and adapt to leg paralysis and then recognize the recovery. The method generates novel behaviors in real time, improving the performance and outperforming the examined state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the robot’s decisions and gained knowledge are interpretable and promise further functional scalability.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining the gait locomotion in an adversarial environment requires the robot to react to novel experiences adaptively. In Free Energy Principle (FEP), the behavioral reaction is driven by the discrepancy between observation and prediction. Although, for legged robot gait locomotion, the prediction of gait dynamics is challenging as the consequences non-linearly depend on the activity history, the animal gait is robust, adapting to severe motion disruptions seemingly instantly. In biomimetic robotics, the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) relaxes the general dynamics of body-environment interaction to the stable and repetitive dynamics of gait. Based on these observations, we propose self-learning of the gait dynamics model and FEP framework that infers state estimation and gait control. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on a real hexapod walking robot with 18 controllable degrees of freedom. The robot learns the gait dynamics model indoors and then deploys it in outdoor navigation under various adversarial scenarios. Results show that the developed interpretable gait controller exhibits complex and real-time adaptive behavior when it encounters unknown situations.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for addressing label ambiguity, offering a more nuanced quantification of the instance–label relationship compared to traditional single-label and multi-label learning approaches. This paper focuses on the challenge of noisy label distributions, which is ubiquitous in real-world applications due to the annotator subjectivity, algorithmic biases, and experimental errors. Existing related LDL algorithms often assume a linear combination of true and random label distributions when modeling the noisy label distributions, an oversimplification that fails to capture the practical generation processes of noisy label distributions. Therefore, this paper introduces an assumption that the noise in label distributions primarily arises from the semantic confusion between labels and proposes a novel generative label distribution learning algorithm to model the confusion-based generation process of both the feature data and the noisy label distribution data. The proposed model is inferred using variational methods and its effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments across various real-world datasets, showcasing its superiority in handling noisy label distributions.",

We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs, our approach has a clear theoretical justification, retains most advantages of standard Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques have gained considerable attention in the field of empirical asset pricing. Conditioning on a broad set of firm characteristics, one of the most popular no-arbitrage workhorses is a nonlinear conditional asset pricing model that consists of two modules within a neural network structure, i.e., factor and beta estimates, for which we propose a novel contrastive adversarial variational Bayes (CAVB) framework. To exploit the factor structure, we employ adversarial variational Bayes that transforms the maximum-likelihood problem into a zero-sum game between a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN), where an auxiliary discriminative network brings in arbitrary expressiveness to the inference model. To tackle the problem of learning indistinguishable feature representations in the beta network, we introduce a contrastive loss to learn distinctive hidden features of the factor loadings in correspondence to conditional quantiles of return distributions. CAVB establishes a robust relation between the cross-section of asset returns and the common latent factors with nonlinear factor loadings. Extensive experiments show that CAVB not only significantly outperforms prominent models in the existing literature in terms of total and predictive R-squares, but also delivers superior Sharpe ratios after transaction costs for both long-only and long-short portfolios.",

Recent state-of-the-art achieved accurate prediction using deep neural networks. However, these end-to-end models are usually black boxes with weak interpretability and generalizability. This paper proposes the Goal-based Neural Variational Agent (GNeVA), an interpretable generative model for motion prediction with robust generalizability to out-of-distribution cases. For interpretability, the model achieves target-driven motion prediction by estimating the spatial distribution of long-term destinations with a variational mixture of Gaussians. We identify a causal structure among maps and agents' histories and derive a variational posterior to enhance generalizability. Experiments on motion prediction datasets validate that the fitted model can be interpretable and generalizable and can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art results.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

Current approaches aim at generating synthesized training data from unpaired samples by exploring the relationship between the corrupted and clean data. This work proposes LUD-VAE, a deep generative method to learn the joint probability density function from data sampled from marginal distributions. Our approach is based on a carefully designed probabilistic graphical model in which the clean and corrupted data domains are conditionally independent. Using variational inference, we maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to estimate the joint probability density function. Furthermore, we show that the ELBO is computable without paired samples under the inference invariant assumption. This property provides the mathematical rationale of our approach in the unpaired setting. Finally, we apply our method to real-world image denoising, super-resolution, and low-light image enhancement tasks and train the models using the synthetic data generated by the LUD-VAE. Experimental results validate the advantages of our method over other approaches.",

In particular, our method employs the $d$-variable Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (dHSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations and arbitrary nuisance factors. We show how to apply this method to a range of problems, including the problems of learning invariant representations and the learning of interpretable representations.

    "abstract": "Active Learning for discriminative models has largely been studied with the focus on individual samples, with less emphasis on how classes are distributed or which classes are hard to deal with. In this work, we show that this is harmful. We propose a method based on the Bayes’ rule, that can naturally incorporate class imbalance into the Active Learning framework. We derive that three terms should be considered together when estimating the probability of a classifier making a mistake for a given sample; i) probability of mislabelling a class, ii) likelihood of the data given a predicted class, and iii) the prior probability on the abundance of a predicted class. Implementing these terms requires a generative model and an intractable likelihood estimation. Therefore, we train a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) for this purpose. To further tie the VAE with the classifier and facilitate VAE training, we use the classifiers’ deep feature representations as input to the VAE. By considering all three probabilities, among them, especially the data imbalance, we can substantially improve the potential of existing methods under limited data budget. We show that our method can be applied to classification tasks on multiple different datasets – including one that is a real-world dataset with heavy data imbalance – significantly outperforming the state of the art.",

VaDA models the generating process of longitudinal data with a unified and well-structured latent space, allowing outcomes prediction, subjects clustering and representation learning simultaneously. The integrated model can be inferred efficiently within a stochastic Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes framework, which is scalable to large datasets and can accommodate variables of mixed type.

    "abstract": "Methods that learn representations of nodes in a graph play an important role in network analysis. Most of the existing methods of graph representation learning have focused on embedding each node in a graph as a single vector in a low-dimensional continuous space. However, these methods have a crucial limitation: the lack of modeling the uncertainty about the representation. In this work, inspired by Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) [22], we propose GraphAVB, a probabilistic generative model to learn node representations that preserve connectivity patterns and capture the uncertainties in the graph. Unlike Graph2Gauss [3] deep which embeds each node as a Gaussian distribution, we represent each node as an implicit distribution parameterized by a neural network in the latent space, which is more flexible and expressive to capture the complex uncertainties in real-world graph-structured datasets. To perform the designed variational inference algorithm with neural samplers, we introduce an auxiliary discriminative network that is used to infer the log probability ratio terms in the objective function and allows us to cast maximizing the objective function as a two-player game. Experimental results on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method GraphAVB, outperforming many competitive baselines on the task of link prediction. The superior performances of our proposed method GraphAVB also demonstrate that the downstream tasks can benefit from the captured uncertainty.",

Recent approaches propose using a generative model to jointly find topics and visualization, allowing the semantics to be infused in the visualization space for a meaningful interpretation. A major challenge that prevents these methods from being used practically is the scalability of their inference algorithms. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first fast Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes based inference method for jointly inferring topics and visualization.

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "In this work, we have proposed a generative model for density estimation, called VAE-KRnet, which combines the canonical variational autoencoder (VAE) with our recently developed flow-based generative model, called KRnet. VAE is used as a dimension reduction technique to capture the latent space, and KRnet is used to model the distribution of the latent variables. Using a linear model between the data and the latent variables, we show that VAE-KRnet can be more effective and robust than the canonical VAE. As an application, we apply VAE-KRnet to variational Bayes to approximate the posterior. The variational Bayes approaches are usually based on the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model and the posterior, which often underestimates the variance if the model capability is not sufficiently strong. However, for high-dimensional distributions, it is very challenging to construct an accurate model since extra assumptions are often needed for efficiency, e.g., the mean-field approach assumes mutual independence between dimensions. When the number of dimensions is relatively small, KRnet can be used to approximate the posterior effectively with respect to the original random variable. For high-dimensional cases, we consider VAE-KRnet to incorporate with the dimension reduction. To alleviate the underestimation of the variance, we include the maximization of the mutual information between the latent random variable and the original one when seeking an approximate distribution with respect to the KL divergence. Numerical experiments have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

    "abstract": "We would like to learn latent representations that are low-dimensional and highly interpretable. A model that has these characteristics is the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The benefits and negative of the GP-LVM are complementary to the Variational Autoencoder, the former provides interpretable low-dimensional latent representations while the latter is able to handle large amounts of data and can use non-Gaussian likelihoods. Our inspiration for this paper is to marry these two approaches and reap the benefits of both. In order to do so we will introduce a novel approximate inference scheme inspired by the GP-LVM and the VAE. We show experimentally that the approximation allows the capacity of the generative bottle-neck (Z) of the VAE to be arbitrarily large without losing a highly interpretable representation, allowing reconstruction quality to be unlimited by Z at the same time as a low-dimensional space can be used to perform ancestral sampling from as well as a means to reason about the embedded data.",

    "abstract": "Clustering is among the most fundamental tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE), a novel unsupervised generative clustering approach within the framework of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, VaDE models the data generative procedure with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a deep neural network (DNN): 1) the GMM picks a cluster; 2) from which a latent embedding is generated; 3) then the DNN decodes the latent embedding into an observable. Inference in VaDE is done in a variational way: a different DNN is used to encode observables to latent embeddings, so that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be optimized using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator and the reparameterization trick. Quantitative comparisons with strong baselines are included in this paper, and experimental results show that VaDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods on 5 benchmarks from various modalities. Moreover, by VaDE's generative nature, we show its capability of generating highly realistic samples for any specified cluster, without using supervised information during training.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, by means of a novel use of insights from the literature on scientific modelling, I will argue in favour of an instrumentalist approach to the models that are crucially involved in the study of adaptive systems within the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) framework. I will begin (§2) by offering a general, informal characterisation of FEP. Then (§3), I will argue that the models involved in FEP-theorising are plausibly intended to be isomorphic to their targets. This will allow (§4) to turn the criticisms moved against isomorphism-based accounts of representation towards the FEP modelling practice. Since failure to establish an isomorphism between model and target would result in the former’s failure to represent the latter, and given that it is highly unlikely that FEP-models are ever isomorphic to their targets, maintaining that FEP-models represent their targets as they are, in a realist sense, is unwarranted. Finally (§5), I will consider what implications my argument in favour of an instrumentalist reading of FEP-models has for attempts at making use of the FEP to elaborate an account of what cognition exactly is. My conclusion is that we should not dismiss FEP-based accounts of cognition, as they would still be informative and would further our understanding of the nature of cognition. Nonetheless, the prospects of settling the philosophical debates that sparked the interest in having a “mark of the cognitive” are not good.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

    "title": "On Free Energy Calculations in Drug Discovery",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Conspectus This Account discusses recent progress and challenges in binding free energy computations, focusing on two classes of enhanced sampling techniques: alchemical transformations and path-based methods. Binding free energy is a crucial metric in drug discovery, as it measures the affinity of a ligand for its target receptor. Free energy and affinity guide the ranking and selection of potential drug candidates. The theoretical foundations of free energy calculations were established several decades ago, but their efficient application to drug-target binding remains a grand challenge in computational drug design. The main obstacles stem from sampling issues (as binding is a rare event), force field accuracy limitations, and simulation convergence. Alchemical transformations are now the most used methods for computing binding free energies in the pharmaceutical industry. However, while they efficiently calculate energy differences, the application of these methods is often limited to relative binding free energy calculations. Absolute and accurate (error < 1 kcal/mol) binding free energy predictions remain one of the great challenges for computational chemists and physicists. Another limitation of alchemical methods is that they lack the ability to provide mechanistic or kinetic insights into the binding process, crucial for optimizing lead compounds and designing novel therapies. Path-based methods offer, in principle, the possibility to accurately estimate absolute binding free energy while also providing insights into binding pathways and interactions. This Account explores recent advances in binding free energy methods for drug-target recognition and binding. In particular, we discuss the similarities and differences between alchemical and path-based approaches, highlighting recent innovations in both families of methods and providing perspectives from our group’s contributions. We examine the foundational role of alchemical methods, which have been employed since the inception of free energy calculations, in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium contexts. We also emphasize the growing importance of path-based methods in drug discovery and their ability to predict binding and unbinding pathways, free energy profiles, and binding free energy estimates. In particular, the combination of path methods with machine learning has proven to be a powerful means for accurate path generation and free energy estimations. Building on our recent research, we discuss several path-based applications for drug discovery. Moreover, we focus on two semiautomatic protocols representing our group’s state-of-the-art in free energy calculations. The first protocol is based on MetaDynamics simulation. From this, a recent innovation is instead based on nonequilibrium simulations combined with nonequilibrium estimators. We discuss in depth the advantages and drawbacks of equilibrium and nonequilibrium approaches to drug-target binding free energy predictions.",

The classical Cahn–Hilliard equation does not satisfy the maximum principle; hence the order parameter can be shifted out of the minimum values of the double‐well potential. We adopt a high‐order polynomial potential to diminish this effect and employ the efficient linear convex splitting scheme. Since the stabilizing factor gradually increases as the degree of potential becomes greater, we modify a non‐physical part of potential as a fourth‐order polynomial to reduce the stabilizing factor. Numerical results as well as theoretical results demonstrate the accuracy and energy stability of our method. Furthermore, we verify that some limitations arising from applications of the classical Cahn–Hilliard model can be resolved by adopting a high‐order free energy.",

    "abstract": "To advance theoretical solutions and address limitations in modeling complex servo-driven actuation systems experiencing high non-linearity and load disturbances, this paper aims to design a practical model-free generic robust control (GRC) framework for these mechanisms. This framework is intended to be applicable across all actuator systems encompassing electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic servomechanisms, while also functioning within complex interactions among dynamic components and adhering to control input constraints. In this respect, the state-space model of actuator systems is decomposed into smaller subsystems that incorporate the first principle equation of actuator motion dynamics and interactive energy conversion equations. This decomposition operates under the assumption that the comprehensive model of the servo-driven actuator system and energy conversion, uncertainties, load disturbances, and their bounds are unknown. Then, the GRC employs subsystem-based adaptive control strategies for each state-variant subsystem separately. Despite control input constraints and the unknown interactive system model, the GRC-applied actuator mechanism ensures uniform exponential stability and robustness in tracking desired motions. It features straightforward implementation, experimentally evaluated by applying it to two industrial applications.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Under the ideal assumption of deploying only one central processing unit (CPU) in the entire system, cell-free (CF) systems can achieve significant macro-diversity gain, thereby providing uniformly reliable service to each user equipment (UE). However, due to limitations in system scalability and the feasibility of strict phase synchronization, CF systems require a multi-CPU setup and perform coherent transmission at a smaller scale. Moreover, conventional CF systems typically operate in time-division duplex (TDD) mode and utilize statistical channel state information (CSI) for downlink (DL) decoding, but the channel hardening effect is not significant. These factors reduce downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and increase DL transmission time, leading to higher energy consumption in CF systems. To address these issues, we introduce downlink channel estimation (DLCE) in multi-CPU CF systems and derive the approximate achievable DL SE. To reduce DL pilot overhead, we propose an uplink–pilot-reuse-constrained DL pilot allocation principle. Based on this principle, we develop a farthest distance pilot allocation (FDPA) algorithm to mitigate pilot contamination. In addition, leveraging the characteristics of the heuristic distributed power allocation algorithm, we propose two access point (AP) clustering algorithms: one based on CSI (BCSI) and the other based on coherent group size (BCGS). Simulation results indicate that the introduction of DLCE significantly improves DL SE in multi-CPU CF massive MIMO systems, while the proposed FDPA algorithm further enhances DL SE. The BCSI and BCGS algorithms also effectively improve DL SE and help reduce energy consumption. By combining DLCE, the FDPA algorithm, and the proposed AP clustering algorithms, the energy consumption of multi-CPU CF systems can be significantly reduced.",

Towards this goal, we demonstrate the post-compression of 5.5 ps pulses with energy in the 0.1 J range by spectral broadening of self-collimated large area beams in air. In proof-of-principle experiments, pulses of 65 mJ energy from a cryogenically cooled Yb:YAG laser were compressed to 1.1 ps after 65 m propagation in a compact setup in which the beam was folded using flat mirrors. Further energy scaling was demonstrated by combining this spectral broadening technique with temporal pulse splitting and recombining. 120 mJ pulses were split into two pulses and coherently recombined with 85% efficiency after 50 m of propagation in air to yield 1.4 ps pulses.",

    "title": "Measurement of Energy Intake Using the Principle of Energy Balance Overcomes a Critical Limitation in the Assessment of Energy Availability",
    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Prolonged low energy availability, which is the underpinning aetiology of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport and the Female and Male Athlete Triad frameworks, can have unfavourable impacts on both health and performance in athletes. Energy availability is calculated as energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure, expressed relative to fat free mass. The current measurement of energy intake is recognized as a major limitation for assessing energy availability due to its reliance on self-report methods, in addition to its short-term nature. This article introduces the application of the energy balance method for the measurement of energy intake, within the context of energy availability. The energy balance method requires quantification of the change in body energy stores over time, with concurrent measurement of total energy expenditure. This provides an objective calculation of energy intake, which can then be used for the assessment of energy availability. This approach, the Energy Availability - Energy Balance (EA EB ) method, increases the reliance on objective measurements, provides an indication of energy availability status over longer periods and removes athlete burden to self-report energy intake. Implementation of the EA EB method could be used to objectively identify and detect low energy availability, with implications for the diagnosis and management of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport and the Female and Male Athlete Triad.",

    "abstract": "Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) is a synthetic model that attempts to unify theories of consciousness within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, with particular emphasis on Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). IWMT further suggests predictive processing in sensory hierarchies may be well-modeled as (folded, sparse, partially disentangled) variational autoencoders, with beliefs discretely-updated via the formation of synchronous complexes—as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs)—potentially entailing maximal a posteriori (MAP) estimation via turbo coding. In this account, alpha-synchronized SOHMs across posterior cortices may constitute the kinds of maximal complexes described by IIT, as well as samples (or MAP estimates) from multimodal shared latent space, organized according to egocentric reference frames, entailing phenomenal consciousness as mid-level perceptual inference. When these posterior SOHMs couple with frontal complexes, this may enable various forms of conscious access as a kind of mental act(ive inference), affording higher order cognition/control, including the kinds of attentional/intentional processing and reportability described by GNWT. Across this autoencoding heterarchy, intermediate-level beliefs may be organized into spatiotemporal trajectories by the entorhinal/hippocampal system, so affording episodic memory, counterfactual imaginings, and planning.",

This article is a review of ongoing research focusing on model dynamics associated with human self-consciousness. It introduces the free energy principle and active inference in terms of Bayesian theory and predictive coding, and then discusses how directed inquiry employing analogous models may bring us closer to representing the sense of self in cognitive neurorobots. The first section quickly locates cognitive neurorobotics in the broad field of computational cognitive modeling. The second section introduces principles according to which cognition may be formalized, and reviews cognitive neurorobotics experiments employing such formalizations. The third section interprets the results of these and other experiments in the context of different senses of self, both “minimal” and “narrative” self. The fourth section considers model validity and discusses what we may expect ongoing cognitive neurorobotics studies to contribute to scientific explanation of cognitive phenomena including the senses of minimal and narrative self.",

Or must this computational simulation be implemented in the right way, in order to replicate consciousness? From the perspective of Karl Friston’s free energy principle, self-organising systems (such as living organisms) share a set of properties that could be realised in artificial systems, but are not instantiated by computers with a classical (von Neumann) architecture. I argue that at least one of these properties, viz. a certain kind of causal flow, can be used to draw a distinction between systems that merely simulate, and those that actually replicate consciousness.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the constraints that the free-energy principle (FEP) places on possible model of consciousness, particularly models of attentional control and imaginative experiences, including episodic memory and planning. We first rehearse the classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, focusing on their application to multi-component systems, in which only some components interact directly with the external environment. In particular, we discuss the role of internal boundaries that have the structure of Markov blankets, and hence function as classical information channels between components. We then show how this formal structure supports models of attentional control and imaginative experience, with a focus on (i) how imaginative experience can employ the spatio-temporal and object-recognition reference frames employed in ordinary, non-imaginative experience and (ii) how imaginative experience can be internally generated but still surprising. We conclude by discussing the implementation, phenomenology, and phylogeny of imaginative experience, and the implications of the large state and trait variability of imaginative experience in humans.",

    "year": 2019,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The current study investigated possible human-robot kinaesthetic interactions using a variational recurrent neural network (RNN) model, called PV-RNN, which is based on the free-energy principle. Our prior robotic studies using PV-RNN showed that the nature of interactions between the top-down expectation and bottom-up inference is strongly affected by a parameter, called the meta-prior, which regulates the complexity term in free energy. The current study examines how changing the meta-prior w in the interaction phase affects the counter force generated when an experimenter attempts to induce movement pattern transitions familiar to the robot through its prior training. The study also compares the counter force generated when trained transitions are induced by a human experimenter and when untrained transitions are induced. Finally, the study examines how different levels of disturbances, pattern level, and cognitive level can be resolved internally across different layers. Our experimental results indicated that 1) the human experimenter needs more/less force to induce trained transitions when w is set with larger/smaller values; 2) the human experimenter needs more force to act on the robot when he attempts to induce untrained as opposed to trained movement pattern transitions; and 3) when the robot was disturbed in the cognitive level, the disturbance was resolved more in the higher layer as compared to the case with disturbance in the pattern level. Our analysis of time development of essential variables and values in PV-RNN during bodily interaction clarified the mechanism by which gaps in action intentions between the human experimenter and the robot can be manifested as reaction forces between them.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents – with little or no training – survive in capricious environments. Autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environment conditions become inconsistent. Here, the authors introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model that embeds robustness directly into the agent decision-making mechanisms through free energy minimization.",

The norm values of cytoplasmic particles were measured by the optical flow method. Three phase profiles for normal cases were found regarding the kinetic energy: 2.199 × 10−24 ± 2.076 × 10−24, 2.369 × 10−24 ± 1.255 × 10−24, and 1.078 × 10−24 ± 4.720 × 10−25 (J) for phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In phase 2, the energies were 2.369 × 10−24 ± 1.255 × 10−24 and 4.694 × 10−24 ± 2.996 × 10−24 (J) (mean ± SD, p = 0.0372), and the time required was 8.114 ± 2.937 and 6.018 ± 5.685 (H) (p = 0.0413) for the normal and abnormal cases, respectively. The kinetic energy change was considered a condition for applying the free energy principle, which states that for any self-organized system to be in equilibrium in its environment, it must minimize its informational free energy. The kinetic energy, while interpreting it in terms of the free energy principle suggesting clinical usefulness, would further our understanding of the phenomenon of fertilized egg development with respect to the birth of human life.",

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) are two ambitious theoretical frameworks, the first aiming to make a general formal description of self-organization and life-like processes, and the second attempting a mathematical theory of conscious experience based on the intrinsic properties of a system. They are each concerned with complementary aspects of the properties of systems, one with life and behavior the other with meaning and experience, so combining them has potentially great scientific value. In this paper, we take a first step towards this synthesis by first partially replicating the results of the evolutionary simulation study by Albantakis et al. (2014) that show a relationship between IIT-measures and fitness in differing complexities of tasks. We then relate FEP-related information theoretic measures to this result, finding that the surprisal of simulated agents’ system states follows the general increase in fitness over evolutionary time, and that it fluctuates together with IIT-based consciousness measures in within-trial time. This suggests that the consciousness measures of IIT indirectly depend on the relation between the agent and the external world, and that they therefore should be related to concepts directly used in the FEP. Lastly, we suggest a future approach for investigating this relationship empirically.",

    "abstract": "Empirical applications of the free-energy principle are not straightforward because they entail a commitment to a particular process theory, especially at the cellular and synaptic levels. Using a recently established reverse engineering technique, we confirm the quantitative predictions of the free-energy principle using in vitro networks of rat cortical neurons that perform causal inference. Upon receiving electrical stimuli—generated by mixing two hidden sources—neurons self-organised to selectively encode the two sources. Pharmacological up- and downregulation of network excitability disrupted the ensuing inference, consistent with changes in prior beliefs about hidden sources. As predicted, changes in effective synaptic connectivity reduced variational free energy, where the connection strengths encoded parameters of the generative model. In short, we show that variational free energy minimisation can quantitatively predict the self-organisation of neuronal networks, in terms of their responses and plasticity. These results demonstrate the applicability of the free-energy principle to in vitro neural networks and establish its predictive validity in this setting.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Active inference (AIF) is a theory of the behavior of information-processing open dynamic systems. It describes them as generative models (GM) generating inferences on the causes of sensory input they receive from their environment. Based on these inferences, GMs generate predictions about sensory input. The discrepancy between a prediction and the actual input results in prediction error. GMs then execute action policies predicted to minimize the prediction error. The free-energy principle provides a rationale for AIF by stipulating that information-processing open systems must constantly minimize their free energy (through suppressing the cumulative prediction error) to avoid decay. The theory of homeostasis and allostasis has a similar logic. Homeostatic set points are expectations of living organisms. Discrepancies between set points and actual states generate stress. For optimal functioning, organisms avoid stress by preserving homeostasis. Theories of AIF and homeostasis have recently converged, with AIF providing a formal account for homeo- and allostasis. In this paper, we present bacterial chemotaxis as molecular AIF, where mutual constraints by extero- and interoception play an essential role in controlling bacterial behavior supporting homeostasis. Extending this insight to the brain, we propose a conceptual model of the brain homeostatic GM, in which we suggest partition of the brain GM into cognitive and physiological homeostatic GMs. We outline their mutual regulation as well as their integration based on the free-energy principle. From this analysis, affect and self-efficacy emerge as the main regulators of the cognitive homeostatic GM. We suggest fatigue and depression as target neurocognitive phenomena for studying the neural mechanisms of such regulation.",

    "abstract": "Organisms are non-equilibrium, stationary systems self-organized via spontaneous symmetry breaking and undergoing metabolic cycles with broken detailed balance in the environment. The thermodynamic free-energy (FE) principle describes an organism’s homeostasis as the regulation of biochemical work constrained by the physical FE cost. By contrast, recent research in neuroscience and theoretical biology explains a higher organism’s homeostasis and allostasis as Bayesian inference facilitated by the informational FE. As an integrated approach to living systems, this study presents an FE minimization theory overarching the essential features of both the thermodynamic and neuroscientific FE principles. Our results reveal that the perception and action of animals result from active inference entailed by FE minimization in the brain, and the brain operates as a Schrödinger’s machine conducting the neural mechanics of minimizing sensory uncertainty. A parsimonious model suggests that the Bayesian brain develops the optimal trajectories in neural manifolds and induces a dynamic bifurcation between neural attractors in the process of active inference.",

    "title": "Resilience phenotypes derived from an active inference account of allostasis",
    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Within a theoretical framework of enactive allostasis, we explore active inference strategies for minimizing surprise to achieve resilience in dynamic environments. While individual differences and extrinsic protective factors traditionally account for variability in resilience trajectories following stressor exposure, the enactive model emphasizes the importance of the physical and social environment, specifically the “enactive niche,” which is both shaped by and impacts organisms living in it, accounting for variable success in allostatic prediction and accommodation. Enactive allostasis infers or predicts states of the world to minimize surprise and maintain regulation after surprise, i.e., resilience. Action policies are selected in accordance with the inferred state of a dynamic environment; those actions concurrently shape one’s environment, buffering against current and potential stressors. Through such inferential construction, multiple potential solutions exist for achieving stability within one’s enactive niche. Spanning a range of adaptive resilience strategies, we propose four phenotypes—fragile, durable, resilient, and pro-entropic (PE)—each characterized by a constellation of genetic, epigenetic, developmental, experiential, and environmental factors. Biological regulatory outcomes range from allostatic (over)load in the fragile and durable phenotypes, to allostatic recovery in resilience, and theoretically to increasing allostatic accommodation or “growth” in the proposed PE phenotype. Awareness distinguishes phenotypes by minimizing allostatically demanding surprise and engenders the cognitive and behavioral flexibility empirically associated with resilience. We further propose a role for awareness in proactively shaping one’s enactive niche to further minimize surprise. We conclude by exploring the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity which may bolster individual resilience.",

This study proposes a minimal, chemically plausible model where homeostasis emerges from a simple chemical reaction network. It utilizes an internal Lotka-Volterra chemical oscillator as a\"search engine\"to periodically vary a protocell's pigmentation. The system then optimizes its internal state by evaluating the temporal correlation between these internal fluctuations and a single global metric,the cell's self-replication rate, through a mechanism termed\"antagonistic memory molecules.\"Numerical simulations demonstrate that the model can autonomously converge to and maintain the optimal temperature for its self-replication, even amidst significant environmental fluctuations.

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Allostasis proposes that long-term viability of a living system is achieved through anticipatory adjustments of its physiology and behaviour: emphasising physiological and affective stress as an adaptive state that minimises long-term prediction errors. More recently, the active inference framework (AIF) has also sought to explain action and long-term adaptation through the minimisation of future errors (free energy), through the learning of statistical contingencies of the world, offering a formalism for allostatic regulation. We suggest that framing prediction errors through the lens of biological hormonal dynamics proposed by allostasis offers a way to integrate these two models together in a biologically-plausible manner. In this paper, we describe our initial work in developing a model that grounds prediction errors (surprisal) into the secretion of a physiological stress hormone (cortisol) acting as an adaptive mediator on a homeostatically-controlled physiology. We evaluate this using a computational model in simulations using an active inference agent endowed with an artificial physiology, regulated through homeostatic and allostatic control in a stochastic environment. Our results find that allostatic functions of cortisol (stress), secreted as a function of prediction errors, provide adaptive advantages to the agent's long-term physiological regulation. We argue that the coupling of information-theoretic prediction errors to low-level, biological hormonal dynamics of stress can provide a computationally efficient model to long-term regulation for embodied intelligent systems.",

Participants were followed for 180 days or until the occurrence of an outcome, whichever came first. We used inverse-probability-weighted models to estimate vaccine effectiveness (calculated as 1 minus the risk ratio) against Covid-19-associated emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths at 6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 6 months of follow-up, the estimated vaccine effectiveness was 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.1 to 39.2) against Covid-19-associated emergency department visits (risk difference per 10,000 persons, 18.3; 95% CI, 10.8 to 27.6), 39.2% (95% CI, 21.6 to 54.5) against Covid-19-associated hospitalizations (risk difference per 10,000 persons, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 13.0), and 64.0% (95% CI, 23.0 to 85.8) against Covid-19-associated deaths (risk difference per 10,000 persons, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.5 to 6.9). Vaccine effectiveness against a composite of these outcomes was 28.3% (95% CI, 18.2 to 38.2), with a risk difference per 10,000 persons of 18.2 (95% CI, 10.7 to 27.5).

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Understanding psychopathological mechanisms is a central goal in clinical science. While existing theories have demonstrated high research and clinical utility, they have provided limited quantitative explanations of mechanisms. Previous computational modeling studies have primarily focused on isolated factors, posing challenges for advancing clinical theories holistically. To address this gap and leverage the strengths of clinical theories and computational modeling in a synergetic manner, it is crucial to develop quantitative models that integrate major factors proposed by comprehensive theoretical models. In this study, using social anxiety disorder (SAD) as an example, we present a novel approach to formalize conceptual models by combining cognitive-behavioral theory (CBT) with active inference modeling, an innovative computational approach that elucidates human cognition and action. This CBT-informed active inference model integrates multiple mechanistic factors of SAD in a quantitative manner. Through a series of simulations, we systematically examined the effects of these factors on the belief about social threat and tendency of engaging in safety behaviors. The resultant model inherits the conceptual comprehensiveness of CBT and the quantitative rigor of active inference modeling, delineating previously elusive pathogenetic pathways and enabling the formulation of concrete model predictions for future research. Overall, this research presents a novel quantitative model of SAD that unifies major mechanistic factors proposed by CBT and active inference modeling. It highlights the feasibility and potential of integrating clinical theory and computational modeling to advance our understanding of psychopathology.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "This article introduces the linguistic active inference theory, which proposes that inner speech augments the brain's predictive processes by transforming prior expectations and sensorimotor predictions to help reduce prediction error and uncertainty. By leveraging language's unique properties-its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, its ability to extend across time and space, and its generativity in constructing novel predictions-inner speech enables predictive processes to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference while decoding abstract goals into situated actions for active control. Linguistic active inference theory provides a unifying framework explaining how inner speech's diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and neurocognitive developmental mechanisms all emerge from its augmentation of perceptual inference and active control. It posits that inner speech dynamically adapts its form and function in response to computational demands and ongoing prediction errors to reduce the imprecision in the brain's generative model. This synthesis advances foundational theories and provides a roadmap for future research: generating novel testable hypotheses, motivating a shift toward dynamic and integrative methodologies, and opening new perspectives on related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In his opening OFC plenary talk back in 2021, Alibaba Group’s Yiqun Cai notably added in the follow-up Q&A that today’s complex networks are more than computer science—they grow, they are life. This entails that future networks may be better viewed as techno-social systems that resemble biological superorganisms with brain-like cognitive capabilities. Fast-forwarding, there is now growing awareness that we have to completely change our networks from being static to being a living entity that would act as an AI-powered network “brain,” as recently stated by Bruno Zerbib, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of France’s Orange, at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025. Even though AI was front and center at both MWC and OFC 2025 and has been widely studied in the context of optical networks, there are currently no publications on active inference in optical (and less so mobile) networks available. Active inference is an ideal methodology for developing more advanced AI systems by biomimicking the way living intelligent systems work while overcoming the limitations of today’s AI related to training, learning, and explainability. Active inference is considered the key to true AI: less artificial, more intelligent. It is a biomimetic mathematical framework that is premised on the first principles of statistical physics found in self-organizing/evolving complex adaptive systems, whether natural, artificial, or hybrid cyborganic ones. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we aim at enabling optical network researchers to conceptualize new research lines for future optical networks with human-AI interaction capabilities by introducing them to the main mathematical concepts of the active inference framework. Second, we demonstrate how to move AI research beyond the human brain toward the 6G world brain by exploring the role of mycorrhizal networks, the largest living organism on planet Earth, in the AI vision and R&D roadmap for the next decade and beyond laid out by Karl Friston, the father of active inference.",

However, in the beginning of November 2024, the volcano activity intensified, culminating in a directed blast eruption on 3rd November at 23:57 Central Indonesian Time from its northwestern upper flank (Kushendratno et al., 2024). This event ignited fires in nearby villages, and resulted in nine fatalities due to exposure to blast material. Subsequently, on 20th March at 22:56 Central Indonesian Time, a vertical explosive eruption occurred from the central vent, generating an eruption column that ascended to approximately 8,000 m (Kristianto et al., 2025), and produced column collapse predominantly affected the west ̶ northeastern flank, causing three reported injuries. These incidents highlight the critical need for proactive eruption forecasting and the implementation of corresponding mitigation strategies. The eruption on 3rd November 2024 prompted a revision of the Lewotobi Lakilaki hazard map, reflecting a newly observed eruptive style with a pronounced northwestern trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: This research focuses on the low problem-solving skills in mathematics of eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 10 Kotabumi, which can be seen from the fact that students struggle to understand problems, show insufficient active participation in discussions, and have a low sense of responsibility in completing tasks. The educational model believed to affect mathematical problem-solving skills is the Two Stay Two Stray (TSTS) learning model. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the TSTS model has an impact on students' mathematical problem-solving abilities in the topics of number patterns and sequences for the 2024/2025 academic year. The research design used is a Quasi-Experimental Design with a Nonequivalent Control Group Design. The subjects of the study are eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 10 Kotabumi in the 2024/2025 academic year. The sampling technique used is Cluster Random Sampling, with classes VIII D and VIII E selected as the samples. A descriptive test instrument was administered at the beginning of the lesson before treatment and at the end of the lesson after the treatment. Based on the t-test analysis, the result showed t_calculated = 2.021 and t_table = 2.000, so t_calculated > t_table, which means H_0 is rejected and H_a is accepted. This indicates that the TSTS learning model has an effect on students' mathematical problem-solving skills in the topics of number patterns and sequences for eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 10 Kotabumi in the 2024/2025 academic year.Keywords: Mathematical Problem-Solving Abilities, Two Stay Two Stray (TSTS) Learning Model, Number Patterns and Sequences, SMP Negeri 10 Kotabumi, Quasi-Experimental Design \n  \nAbstrak: Masalah penelitian ini berfokus pada rendahnya keahlian pemecahan permasalahan matematis siswa kelas VIII SMP Negeri 10 Kotabumi yang dapat dilihat berdasarkan penelitian siswa kurang dalam memahamii masalah, kurangnya partisipasi aktif dalam diskusi materi pembelajaran, serta rendahnya rasa tanggung jawab dalaam menyelesaikan tugas.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants, resulting in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide every year. Nirsevimab, a long‐acting monoclonal antibody approved in 2023, has 75%–90% protection against RSV‐related admissions. This study evaluated the effectiveness of nirsevimab in preventing RSV‐hospitalization among infants in southern Italy during 2024–2025 season. Active surveillance was conducted in all hospitals in the Foggia district. Infants born between January 2024 and March 2025 who were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections from October 2024 to April 2025 were tested for RSV. Information on immunoprophylaxis was provided by the Regional Immunization Information System. The effectiveness of nirsevimab was estimated using the screening method, a test‐negative case‐control design and a cohort study approach. Of the 4820 eligible infants, 2635 (54.7%) were immunized. Of the 256 infants admitted with lower respiratory tract infections, 82 tested positives for RSV; of these, 13 had received immunoprophylaxis. The effectiveness was estimated to be 84.4% (95% CI: 71.7–91.4%) using the screening method, 72.5% (42.1%–87.0%) using the test‐negative design, and 81.6% (66.4–90.0) using the cohort approach. As in previous study, these findings showed than nirsevimab provide substantial protection against RSV‐related hospitalization.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Education plays a very important role in improving the quality of human resources. One of the main problems in education in Indonesia is the low learning outcomes of students, partly due to the use of inappropriate learning methods. The problem-based learning (PBL) model is one approach that can improve students' critical thinking skills because it emphasizes active and independent solving of real problems. This study aims to determine the effect of the problem-based learning (PBL) model on students' critical thinking skills in Economics class XI at MA As Salamah in the 2024/2025 academic year. The background of this study is the low critical thinking skills of students due to conventional learning methods. The approach used was quantitative with simple linear regression analysis. The research instruments were tested for validity and reliability, with all items declared valid (r > 0.306) and reliable (α = 0.802 for X and 0.797 for Y). The normality test showed that the residual data were normally distributed (p = 0.200; Monte Carlo Sig. = 0.841). The regression analysis results showed an R value of 0.965 and an R² value of 0.932, and the t-test showed a significant effect of variable X on Y (p < 0.001). Thus, PBL has a positive and significant effect on students' critical thinking skills.\n ",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "In this review on universal emotions, brief summaries are given on studies published in 2024–2025. In this current literature, happiness is noted to be elicited by physical activity and involves the orbitofrontal cortex. Surprise reportedly enhances memory but only if it’s a plausible surprise. For sadness, the right temporal and left superior frontal areas have been notably more active. The neural responses of fear have varied by the different video clips of spiders, heights and social threats. Humor is ideal for managing fear in terms of their different neural chemistry and physiological effects. Anger is reciprocally related to anxiety and mediates the relationship between strain and aggression. Disgust is the last emotion that is recognized across development and is evoked by ancient threats like body waste products and worms, while fear is elicited by modern threats like electricity and car accidents. Disgust is, surprisingly, more resistant to extinction than fear. Most of the studies in this literature are focused on situations that evoke a particular emotion. Emotions have rarely been compared for their different elicitors and different effects. And cross-cultural comparisons are also missing from this literature, possibly because these emotions have been considered universal.",

In this context, the districts of Çankaya and Sincan, which are separated by different lines in terms of their socio-economic structure, were compared. The research uses a quantitative design to examine the differences created by factors such as education level and economic status in processes ranging from brand loyalty to personal image management. SPSS analysis of data collected from 110 participants in 2024 enables discussion of the differentiation between these two regions using concrete data. Frequency and percentage distributions were compared between settlement units. The findings show that socio-spatial differences within the settlement area have a decisive impact on fashion perception, consumption practices, and everyday clothing preferences. Additionally, insights are provided into how individual styles in the digital fashion environment acquire different meanings when considered alongside individuals’ social status and the urban environment in which they live. The study aims to contribute to current research on differences in local fashion culture in Turkey from a socio-spatial perspective.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the use of Islamic values-based clay as a learning medium to enhance early childhood creativity at RA GUPPI Klesem. Creativity is a crucial aspect that should be developed from an early age, involving imaginative thinking, problem-solving, and fine motor skills. Clay was chosen as an innovative medium due to its flexibility, ease of shaping, and potential for integration with Islamic values such as ethics and morality. Children were encouraged to create Islamic-themed shapes, such as Arabic letters, miniature mosques, and other religious symbols. This study employed a qualitative descriptive method with a case study approach. Data were collected through observation, interviews, and documentation. The research subjects included teachers and children at RA GUPPI Klesem, with parents' involvement to support learning at home. The results show that clay significantly improved children's creativity, particularly in fine motor skills, imagination, and understanding of Islamic values. Children became more active, enthusiastic, and capable of producing creative, educational works. Moreover, the involvement of teachers and parents played a vital role in strengthening the effectiveness of learning. Thus, Islamic values-based clay learning media can be an innovative alternative to support creativity and character development in early childhood education.\nKeywords:  Clay; Islamic Values; Creativit;, Early Childhood Education",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBiology learning in schools still faces various obstacles, such as low motivation and activeness of students and the use of media and learning models that are less interesting. In addition, the implementation of laboratory practicums is also less than optimal due to limited facilities, time, and supporting staff, which has an impact on the low active participation of students in the learning process. This study aims to determine and describe the implementation of biology practicum activities at SMA Negeri 1 Gowa. This type of research is descriptive research using quantitative and qualitative approaches (mix method). Data were collected through filling out checklists, interviews, and documentation. The results of the study showed that the implementation of biology practicums at SMA Negeri 1 Gowa referring to the Learning Outcomes (CP) of the Independent Curriculum reached 68% with a fairly good category in the laboratory. The practicums carried out in class XI included observations of diffusion, osmosis, mitosis and meiosis, human skeletal torso, blood type, blood pressure, pulse rate, and starch and glucose tests, while those that were not carried out were calorie calculations on the 4 healthy 5 perfect menu, vitamin tests, and fat tests. There were several obstacles in the implementation of biology practicums, including several microscopes in poor condition (blurry), practicums were carried out in class due to schedules that clashed with other subjects, students did not yet understand the basics of implementing practicums, limited time and water, practicums coincided with school events, and the unavailability of guides and Student Worksheets (LKPD) in several classes.\nABSTRAK\nPembelajaran biologi di sekolah masih menghadapi berbagai kendala, seperti rendahnya motivasi dan keaktifan peserta didik serta penggunaan media dan model pembelajaran yang kurang menarik.

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The Goose/Guandong lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996(H5N1)] is the progenitor of the currently circulating Eurasian-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b and has been the most consequential highly pathogenic avian influenza lineage globally. Despite increased reports of infections, the extent of exposure and role of wild mammals in the ecology and transmission dynamics of the virus remains poorly understood. We surveyed wild mammals in Ohio, United States to investigate the potential spillover of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b. While no active infections—defined as positive results indicative of viral replication and potential propagation—were detected by swab-based molecular tests, serological assays revealed antibodies against multiple avian influenza virus antigens in raccoons and opossums. Specifically, antibodies to avian influenza virus nucleoprotein were detected in 54.9% (n = 61) of samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; antibodies to Eurasian-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 clade 2.3.4.4b and North American low pathogenic avian influenza H5 were detected in 43.2% (n = 48) and 22.5% (n = 25) of samples, respectively, using virus neutralization assays; and antibodies to avian influenza virus neuraminidase were detected in 44.1% (n = 49) of samples using enzyme-linked lectin assay. All seropositive animals were sampled at Ohio marshes with previously confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 detections in waterfowl. These findings suggest prior exposure of wild mammals to these viruses without mortality events. Wild mammals may play an intermediary role in the mammalian adaptation of avian influenza A viruses. Therefore, ongoing surveillance of wild mammals is crucial for assessing the risk to public health.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to describe: (a) the implementation of Index Card Match media-based teaching modules in learning the skills of writing observation report texts, (b) the implementation of Index Card Match media in learning activities, and (c) student learning outcomes after the implementation of Index Card Match media in learning to write observation report texts. This study uses a qualitative descriptive approach with a natural observation type. The results of the study indicate that the implementation of open modules with the integration of Index Card Match media is systematically arranged by containing learning components that are in accordance with the Independent Curriculum. The implementation of Index Card Match media in learning shows positive results. During the activity, students looked enthusiastic and active in interacting with their peers. This is evidenced by the results of the final test which showed an average score of 72.63. This value shows that most students have achieved the Learning Objective Achievement Criteria (KKTP) in the Independent Curriculum because the independent curriculum no longer uses the term KKM or Minimum Completion Criteria set by the school.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We argue here that the Origin of Life (OOL) problem is not just a chemistry problem but is also, and primarily, a cognitive science problem. When interpreted through the lens of the Conway-Kochen theorem and the Free Energy Principle, contemporary physics characterizes all complex dynamical systems that persist through time as Bayesian agents. If all persistent systems are to some – perhaps only minimal – extent cognitive, are all persistent systems to some extent alive, or are living systems only a subset of cognitive systems? We argue that no bright line can be drawn, and we re-assess, from this perspective, the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation. We conclude that improving our abilities to recognize and communicate with diverse intelligences in diverse embodiments, whether based on familiar biochemistry or not, will either resolve or obviate the OOL problem.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Social interaction takes various forms, ranging from cooperation to conflict. The current study focused on competition between top-down and bottom-up information processes in perception and action generation in social interaction, based on the free energy principle. In particular, it attempted to account for the sense of agency. We built a computational model for multimodal social interaction with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, based on the free energy principle, and we evaluated the model in imitative interaction between a human and a robot. Our findings demonstrate that when prioritization of the top-down process is enhanced, the robot behaves egocentrically, leading the human more and manifesting a stronger sense of agency. Conversely, when this prioritization is reduced, the robot tends to modify its intention so that it aligns with that of its human counterpart, suggesting a weaker sense of agency. We also proposed a computational model for a multifactorial account of the sense of agency and examined the correspondence between the experimental results and the model. The study reveals the underlying mechanism of social interaction dynamics and the resultant sense of agency by conducting a rigorous analysis of the neural internal representation, as well as the behaviors of the human and the robot.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The relationship between Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Free-Energy Principle (FEP) remains unresolved, particularly with respect to how integrated information, proposed as the intrinsic substrate of consciousness, behaves within variational Bayesian inference. We investigated this issue using dissociated neuronal cultures, previously shown to perform perceptual inference consistent with the FEP. Repeated stimulation from hidden sources induced robust source selectivity: variational free energy (VFE) decreased across sessions, whereas accuracy and Bayesian surprise (complexity) increased. Network-level analyses revealed that a proxy measure of integrated information and the size of the main complex followed a hill-shaped trajectory, with informational cores organizing diverse neuronal activity. Across experiments, integrated information correlated strongly and positively with Bayesian surprise, modestly and heterogeneously with accuracy, and showed no significant relationship with VFE. The positive coupling between {\\Phi} and Bayesian surprise likely reflects the diversity of activity observed in critical dynamics. These findings suggest that integrated information increases specifically during belief updating, when sensory inputs are most informative, rather than tracking model efficiency. The hill-shaped trajectory of {\\Phi} during inference can be functionally interpreted as a transition from exploration to exploitation. This work provides empirical evidence linking the physical account of consciousness advanced by IIT with the functional perspective offered by the FEP, contributing to a unified framework for the mechanisms and adaptive roles of phenomenology.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "The hypothesis that a robot’s active behavior improves people’s perception of agency toward the robot is examined through observation of interactions between human participants and a real robot and through questionnaires. Because of the cute appearance and childlike behavior of social robots, people have conventionally felt that the robots rely on people. In order for robots to be introduced into more situations, such as caregiving, it is also necessary for people to feel that they can rely on robots. The key to making people feel that they can rely on robots is to improve their perception of agency toward the robot. Humans are generally considered to have agency, and they behave actively based on their motivation to achieve certain goals. If a robot behaves actively based on the equivalent of a human’s motivation, then the people’s perception of agency toward the robot would be improved. We had human participants interact with a robot that had implemented the equivalent of a human’s motivation using the Free Energy Principle. Although not statistically significant, the results suggest a possible trend toward improved perception of agency for robots that showed active behavior compared to those that did not.",

    "title": "An active inference implementation of phototaxis",
    "year": 2017,
    "abstract": "Active inference is emerging as a possible unifying theory of perception and action in cognitive and computational neuroscience. On this theory, perception is a process of inferring the causes of sensory data by minimising the error between actual sensations and those predicted by an inner \\emph{generative} (probabilistic) model. Action on the other hand is drawn as a process that modifies the world such that the consequent sensory input meets expectations encoded in the same internal model. These two processes, inferring properties of the world and inferring actions needed to meet expectations, close the sensory/motor loop and suggest a deep symmetry between action and perception. In this work we present a simple agent-based model inspired by this new theory that offers insights on some of its central ideas. Previous implementations of active inference have typically examined a \"perception-oriented\" view of this theory, assuming that agents are endowed with a detailed generative model of their surrounding environment. In contrast, we present an \"action-oriented\" solution showing how adaptive behaviour can emerge even when agents operate with a simple model which bears little resemblance to their environment. We examine how various parameters of this formulation allow phototaxis and present an example of a different, \"pathological\" behaviour.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Theory and simulations are used to demonstrate implementation of a variational Bayes algorithm called \"active inference\" in interacting arrays of nanomagnetic elements. The algorithm requires stochastic elements, and a simplified model based on a magnetic artificial spin ice geometry is used to illustrate how nanomagnets can generate the required random dynamics. Examples of tracking and PID control are demonstrated and shown to be consistent with the original stochastic differential equation formulation of active inference. Interestingly, nonlinear response in the form of spikes and spike trains not predicted by the original theory can appear in the nanomagnet system for certain temperature regimes. A theoretical approach using a mean-field approximation for spin systems is proposed, which describes the transition to nonlinear response. Finally, the possibility to create simple magnetic arrays using realistic models is shown with micromagnetic simulations of a simple 17 element array of nanomagnets that include magnetic anisotropies, and exchange and dipolar interactions. Possible applications are simulated to illustrate how nanomagnetic arrays can be used as the stochastic element for feedback control of processes, investigation and control of magnetic state evolution, and as a method to optimize pulsed field magnetic switching protocols.",

    "title": "SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CO-ACTIVE NEURO-FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "The article deals with the implementation of a neural network with fuzzy logic based on the Co-Active Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS) model. The CANFIS model is an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system that combines neural networks and fuzzy logic for processing data with uncertainty and fuzziness. CANFIS uses fuzzy rules and output mechanisms to convert input data into output values. It consists of several layers, including an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer, where each layer contains neurons performing fuzzy activation and output of results. The relevance of the work lies in the fact that the software implementation of the CANFIS model, based on the STL of the C++ language, is of great importance in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analysis. The work’s results can be applied in various fields, including when making decisions based on fuzzy logic. Special feature of the studied and developed model is to create an adaptive model capable of modeling systems with uncertainty and blurriness. The developed model is able to process data and make decisions based on fuzzy rules. CANFIS finds applications in various fields, including forecasting, management, classification and data analysis. It can be concluded that the developed neural network with fuzzy logic can be effectively applied in various fields where time series forecasting, system management and decision-making based on fuzzy information are used.",

This means that POMDP active inference models can now be easily fit to empirically observed behaviour using sampling, as well as variational methods.

    "title": "Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models",
    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston&de Vries, 2017; Parr&Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.",

These constraints necessitate a unified framework: active inference, underpinned by the free energy principle (FEP).

While the framework has seen significant advancements in the development of agents, the environmental models are often borrowed from reinforcement learning problems, which may not fully capture the complexity of multi-agent interactions or allow complex, conditional communication. This paper introduces Reactive Environments, a comprehensive paradigm that facilitates complex multi-agent communication. In this paradigm, both agents and environments are defined as entities encapsulated by boundaries with interfaces. This setup facilitates a robust framework for communication in nonequilibrium-Steady-State systems, allowing for complex interactions and information exchange. We present a Julia package RxEnvironments.jl, which is a specific implementation of Reactive Environments, where we utilize a Reactive Programming style for efficient implementation. The flexibility of this paradigm is demonstrated through its application to several complex, multi-agent environments.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that key definitions of basal cognition and sentient behavior may arise as emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks. Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Cognitive self-organization rests on activity-dependent plasticity to extend the ontogenetic process of neural differentiation and integration of the cerebral cortex in each act of cognition. This account of neurocognitive growth can be formulated in terms of active inference and learning. The organism regulates synaptic connectivity as it seeks its goals actively, through excitatory, feedforward expectancies that manifest its species-specific affordances. These adaptive expectancies are modified reactively, through inhibitory feedback error-correction to fit and predict environmental encounters. Although adaptive behavior, and concomitant synaptic plasticity, occur during waking, the synaptic architecture requires ongoing consolidation and refinement during sleep. We propose that memory consolidation during sleep is a continuation of the neurodevelopmental process that proceeds through a kind of inversion of waking active inference: NREM sleep first refines the brain's representations of new, unpredicted experiences during waking, implementing inhibitory mechanisms of long-term depression that both differentiate and stabilize new representations for consolidation. REM sleep then updates the organism's generative world model in light of this new learning through excitatory long-term potentiation of synaptic plasticity. REM thereby reconsolidates and integrates the organism's adaptive, feedforward predictions, the Bayesian priors for effective coping.",

We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.",

This paper proposes a driving intention direct inference method, namely direct inference from the road surface condition. A driving intention safety distance model based on a deep neural network with dropout regularization was built in an active collision avoidance control system of electric vehicles. Driving intention can be inferred by a deep neural network with dropout regularization from adhesion coefficients between the tire and road. Simulations using rapid control prototyping (RCP) and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed driving intention safety distance model based on a deep neural network with dropout regularization.

    "year": 2020,
    "abstract": "Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.",

Important considerations are correlation with error, overhead during training and inference, and efficient workflows to systematically improve the force field.

Here, we present a generalization of the deep-ensemble design based on multiheaded neural networks and a heteroscedastic loss. It can efficiently deal with uncertainties in both energy and forces and take sources of aleatoric uncertainty affecting the training data into account. We compare uncertainty metrics based on deep ensembles, committees, and bootstrap-aggregation ensembles using data for an ionic liquid and a perovskite surface. We demonstrate an adversarial approach to active learning to efficiently and progressively refine the force fields.

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) has emerged as a pivotal technology for secure neural network inference (SNNI), offering privacy-preserving computations on encrypted data. Despite active developments in this field, HE-based SNNI frameworks are impeded by three inherent limitations. Firstly, they cannot evaluate non-linear functions such as ReLU, the most widely adopted activation function in neural networks. Secondly, the permitted number of homomorphic operations on ciphertexts is bounded, consequently limiting the depth of neural networks that can be evaluated. Thirdly, the computational overhead associated with HE is prohibitively high, particularly for deep neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm designed to address the three limitations of HE-based SNNI. Our approach is an interactive approach that is solely based on HE, called iLHE. Utilizing the idea of iLHE, we present two protocols: ReLU, which facilitates the direct evaluation of the ReLU function on encrypted data, tackling the first limitation, and HeRefresh, which extends the feasible depth of neural network computations and mitigates the computational overhead, thereby addressing the second and third limitations. Based on HeReLU and HeRefresh protocols, we build a new framework for SNNI, named HeFUN. We prove that our protocols and the HeFUN framework are secure in the semi-honest security model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeFUN surpasses current HE-based SNNI frameworks in multiple aspects, including security, accuracy, the number of communication rounds, and inference latency. Specifically, for a convolutional neural network with four layers on the MNIST dataset, HeFUN achieves 99.16% accuracy with an inference latency of 1.501 s, surpassing the popular HE-based framework CryptoNets proposed by Gilad-Bachrach, which achieves 98.52% accuracy with an inference latency of 3.479 s.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Previous work optimizes traditional active learning (AL) processes with incremental neural network architecture search (Active-iNAS) based on data complexity change, which improves the accuracy and learning efficiency. However, Active-iNAS trains several models and selects the model with the best generalization performance for querying the subsequent samples after each active learning cycle. The independent training processes lead to an insufferable computational budget, which is significantly inefficient and limits search flexibility and final performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel active strategy with the method called structured variational inference (SVI) or structured neural depth search (SNDS) whereby we could use the gradient descent method in neural network depth search during AL processes. At the same time, we theoretically demonstrate that the current VI-based methods based on the mean-field assumption could lead to poor performance. We apply our strategy using three querying techniques and three datasets and show that our strategy outperforms current methods.",

    "year": 2025,
    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled the integration of intelligence into low-end Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, traditional DL inference on resource-constrained microcontrollers (MCUs) faces significant memory and computational challenges. This article presents a novel compression and reconstruction method for on-chip memory optimization enabling the DL model on such MCUs. We exploit a low-rank approximation technique to decompose the deep neural network (DNN) weight matrix into lower-rank sub-matrices that occupy less Flash memory than the uncompressed matrix. Further, we propose a novel layer-wise kernel reconstruction (LaWKeR) technique for static random access memory (SRAM) and FLOPS reduction. The LaWKeR reconstructs only the active kernel directly from compressed weights stored in Flash, unlike existing methods which reconstruct the whole compressed weight matrix during run-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on a NUCLEO board using the STM32F401 microcontroller. The LaWKeR method reduces the model size from 73KB to 20.4KB of Flash and RAM usage of only 21.34KB, using only 4.20% and 21.28% of the total embedded memory, respectively. It requires less memory than popular frameworks like tinyML and neural architecture search and can be combined with other techniques for even smaller models.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has brought significant advances to robotics vision tasks. However, most existing DL methods have a major shortcoming - they rely on a static inference paradigm inherent in traditional computer vision pipelines. On the other hand, recent studies have found that active perception improves the perception abilities of various models by going beyond these static paradigms. Despite the significant potential of active perception, it poses several challenges, primarily involving significant changes in training pipelines for deep learning models. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic supervised active perception pipeline for object detection that can be trained using existing off-the-shelf object detectors, while also leveraging advances in simulation environments. To this end, the proposed method employs an additional neural network architecture that estimates better viewpoints in cases where the object detector confidence is insufficient. The proposed method was evaluated on synthetic datasets - constructed within the Webots robotics simulator -, showcasing its effectiveness in two object detection cases.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Classification of electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI-EEG) tasks is crucial in brain–computer interface (BCI). EEG signals require a large number of channels in the acquisition process, which hinders its application in practice. How to select the optimal channel subset without a serious impact on the classification performance is an urgent problem to be solved in the field of BCIs. This article proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework, called EEG channel active inference neural network (EEG-ARNN), which is based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to fully exploit the correlation of signals in the temporal and spatial domains. Two channel selection methods, i.e., edge-selection (ES) and aggregation-selection (AS), are proposed to select a specified number of optimal channels automatically. Two publicly available BCI Competition IV 2a (BCICIV 2a) dataset and PhysioNet dataset and a self-collected dataset (TJU dataset) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both classification accuracy and robustness. Using only a small number of channels, we obtain a classification performance similar to that of using all channels. Finally, the association between selected channels and activated brain areas is analyzed, which is important to reveal the working state of brain during MI.",

    "year": 2024,
    "abstract": "Continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) monitors multiwavelength variability signatures to constrain accretion disk structure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will survey tens of millions of AGN over the next decade, with thousands of AGN monitored with almost daily cadence in the deep drilling fields. However, existing CRM methodologies often require long computation time and are not designed to handle such large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a fast and flexible inference framework for CRM using simulation-based inference (SBI) with deep learning to estimate SMBH properties from AGN light curves. We use a long short-term memory summary network to reduce the high dimensionality of the light curve data and then use a neural density estimator to estimate the posterior of SMBH parameters. Using simulated light curves, we find SBI can produce more accurate SMBH parameter estimation with 103–105 times speed up in inference efficiency compared to traditional methods. The SBI framework is particularly suitable for wide-field CRM surveys as the light curves will have identical observing patterns, which can be incorporated into the SBI simulation. We explore the performance of our SBI model on light curves with irregular-sampled, realistic observing cadence and alternative variability characteristics to demonstrate the flexibility and limitation of the SBI framework.",

Across model scales (1.5B--30B), we observe a sharp reduction in effective dimensionality consistent with a phase transition: an order parameter based on sparsity/localization, $\\Omega(h)=1-\\|h\\|_1/(\\sqrt{d}\\|h\\|_2)$, exhibits a discontinuity near a critical normalized depth $\\gamma_c\\approx 0.42$ in sufficiently large models. We formalize the forward pass as a discrete coarse-graining map and relate the appearance of stable\"concept basins\"to fixed points of this renormalization-like dynamics. The resulting low-entropy regime is characterized by a spectral tail collapse and by the formation of transient, reusable object-like structures in representation space, which we call Transient Class Objects (TCOs). We provide theoretical conditions connecting logical separability to spectral decay and validate the predicted signatures with layerwise probes on multiple open-weight model families.",

    "abstract": "The asymmetry between the left and right sides seems to be a general principle of organization of the nervous systems in Bilateria, providing the foundations for a plethora of leftward and rightward biases in behaviour as documented in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes to humans. Several theories have been put forward to account for the existence and maintenance in the evolution of the asymmetric organization of the brain at both individual and population levels. However, what is missing in theorizing about the evolution of brain asymmetry is an overarching general hypothesis that may subsume all different aspects of current models. Here, we tried to provide an overarching general framework based on the energy and free-energy minimization principle, which proved so valuable in other areas of neuroscience. We found that at the individual level the antisymmetric singlet configuration realizes the lowest energy state of the system, whereas at the group level, the spontaneous emergence of directional asymmetry arises as a consequence of the minimization of the free energy of the system, which guarantees its stability and equilibrium. We thus argue that the various phenomenological aspects of brain asymmetry that have been captured in biology—e.g. sparing of neural tissue, control of unitary motor responses and, at the population level, evolutionarily stable strategies described by mathematical games theory—may be thought of as the manifestation of a more general principle of energy minimization generating, among others, asymmetry of the brains.",

In four dimensions, we derive an exact sum rule relating this operator to the Euler coefficient in the trace anomaly, and show that the ANEC implies the a-theorem. The argument is based on matching anomalies in the stress tensor 3-point function, and relies on special properties of contact terms involving light-ray operators. We also illustrate the sum rule for the example of a free massive scalar field. Averaged null energy appears in a variety of other applications to quantum field theory, including causality constraints, Lorentzian inversion, and quantum information. The quantum information perspective provides a new derivation of the a-theorem from the monotonicity of relative entropy. The equation relating our sum rule to the dilaton scattering amplitude in the forward limit suggests an inversion formula for non-conformal theories.",

    "year": 2023,
    "abstract": "Accurate multireference electronic structure calculations are important for constructing potential energy surfaces. Still, even in the case of low-scaling methods, their routine use is limited by the steep growth of the computational and storage costs as the active space grows. This is primarily due to the occurrence of three- and higher-body density matrices or, equivalently, their cumulants. This work examines the effect of various cumulant truncation schemes on the accuracy of the driven similarity renormalization group second-order multireference perturbation theory. We test four different levels of three-body reduced density cumulant truncations that set different classes of cumulant elements to zero. Our test cases include the singlet-triplet gap of CH2, the potential energy curves of the XΣg+1 and AΣu+3 states of N2, and the singlet-triplet splittings of oligoacenes. Our results show that both relative and absolute errors introduced by these cumulant truncations can be as small as 0.5 kcal mol-1 or less. At the same time, the amount of memory required is reduced from O(NA6) to O(NA5), where NA is the number of active orbitals. No additional regularization is needed to prevent the intruder state problem in the cumulant-truncated second-order driven similarity renormalization group multireference perturbation theory methods.",

    "abstract": "The development of tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm in higher dimensions is an important and urgent task, as the TRG is expected to provide a way to overcome the sign problem in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations at finite density. One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.",
