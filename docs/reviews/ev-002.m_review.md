## 発見事項
- (Low) **File Discrepancy**: Requested file `scripts/attractor_dashboard.py` does not exist. Analyzed `scripts/fep_dashboard.py` as the likely intended target (due to matching FEP/series visualization functionality).
- (Low) **Theorem Uncovered**: The PROOF tag `[L3/ユーティリティ]` in `fep_dashboard.py` does not map to any of the 24 Theorems (O/S/H/P/K/A series). While a utility script, its functionality aligns with Observation (O-series) or Structure (S-series), creating a formal coverage gap.
- (Low) **X-series Unimplemented**: The dashboard visualizes all 6 series (O, S, H, P, K, A) but treats them as independent counters. It does not implement the cross-series interaction logic (X-series) defined in the system's theoretical framework, missing an opportunity to visualize systemic interplay.
