Covers key features like the 1M token context window, Adaptive Thinking, and Context Compaction. Documents the Shift to \"Agent Teams\" in coding tasks and the performance benchmarks (Terminal-Bench, GDPval-AA) that establish Claude's position in the frontier model landscape. This KI serves as a reference for optimizing Hegemonikón's context management and multi-agent orchestration strategies.",
