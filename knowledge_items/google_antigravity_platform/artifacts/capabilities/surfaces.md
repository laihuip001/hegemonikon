# Antigravity Interface Surfaces

Antigravity utilizes a multi-surface architecture to separate implementation, coordination, and external interaction.

## 1. The Editor (AI-Powered IDE)

The Editor is a fully-functional development environment enhanced by inline AI interactions.

- **Tab (Autocomplete)**: Predictive code completion based on project context.
- **Command (Inline Instructions)**: Direct manipulation of code blocks via natural language.
- **Agent Side Panel**: A persistent sidebar for asking questions about the current file or project.
- **Review & Source Control**: Integrated diff views and Git integration for staging and committing changes.

## 2. Agent Manager (Orchestration & Planning)

The Agent Manager is the "command center" for agentic workflows. It is typically accessed via **Cmd + E** from the Editor.

- **Planning Mode**: A "non-code" view where agents and human creators can outline high-level implementation plans.
- **Workspace Management**: Organizing agents and tasks into logical groups.
- **Artifact Review**: High-fidelity views for reviewing plans, walkthroughs, and diagrams generated by agents.
- **Focus Editor**: A navigational shortcut to return to implementation.

## 3. Browser Agent (Preview)

The Browser Agent enables agents to act on web-based surfaces, bridging the gap between local code and the wider internet/intranet.

- **Capabilities**:
  - Scanning dashboards.
  - Performing SCM actions (e.g., merging PRs on GitHub).
  - Executing UI/UX testing.
- **Recording**: Captures browser interactions as artifacts for human review and debugging.
- **Whitelisting**: Fine-grained control over which domains the browser subagent can access.

## 4. Rules & Profiles (Configuration)

This surface defines the AI's persona, constraints, and project profile.

- **GEMINI.md**: A project-level profile (typically in `~/.gemini/`) that Antigravity injects into the AI's context as "Rules."
- **Always On Rules**: Directory-level markdown files (e.g., `.agent/rules/`) that are persistently applied to the agent's behavior.
- **Role**: Ensures cognitive alignment and provides the AI with an authoritative list of available workflows and doctrines.

### Operational Boundaries (Negative Constraints)

The Browser Agent is strictly limited to **web-based surfaces** and Chromium-compatible environments.

- **❌ No Native Desktop Automation**: It cannot actuate or interact with standalone desktop applications (e.g., FileMaker Pro, Excel, specialized IDEs).
- **❌ No Local File Dialogs**: Interaction with system-level file picker dialogs is unsupported.
- **❌ Sandbox Limitations**: It cannot bypass OS-level security or hardware-specific drivers.

*Insight*: For FileMaker development, the Browser Agent cannot automate the initial GUI-based Skeleton generation, confirming the necessity of a Hybrid Workflow (Manual GUI + Programmatic XML).

## Surface Navigation

| Action | Shortcut | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Toggle Editor/Manager** | `Cmd + E` | Switches focus between Implementation and Orchestration. |
| **Open Agent Side Panel** | (Varies) | Opens AI context within the editor. |
| **Navigate to Workspace** | Via Dropdown | Switches between project contexts in the Manager. |
