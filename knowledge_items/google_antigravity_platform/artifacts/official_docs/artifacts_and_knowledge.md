# Artifacts & Knowledge

## Artifacts

Artifacts are structured formats the agent creates to communicate work or thinking (markdown, diffs, diagrams). Emphasis is on asynchronous communication and user feedback.

## Shared Artifact Types

- **Task List**: Markdown-based list used by the agent to monitor progress on complex goals (research, implementation, verification).
- **Implementation Plan**: Details how the agent architects changes. Users can review, comment, and "Proceed" to authorize execution.
- **Walkthrough**: Summarizes completed implementations. Often includes visual evidence (screenshots/recordings) for verification.

## Visual Verification

- **Screenshots**: Browser subagent captures pages or specific elements for user review.
- **Browser Recordings**: Playback of agent actions in the browser for audit and review.

- **Purpose**: Captures insights and patterns across sessions.
