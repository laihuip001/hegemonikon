# FileMaker Integration Project: Status & Progress Report

> **Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Community Success Search & Validation
> **Project Code**: PRODUCTION-CORE-FM
> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-05

## 1. Project Objective

The goal of the "Production Core" initiative is to use the Hegemonikón IDE as the design and logic engine for FileMaker development. This is achieved by generating FileMaker Add-on (`.fmaddon`) packages directly from the AI-designed architectural schemas (Markdown/SaXML), bypassing the overhead of manual GUI-based development for core structures.

## 2. Iteration History & Lessons Learned

| Version | Status | Key Findings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v1 - v3** | Failed | Basic JSON/XML structures are not recognized by the FileMaker Pro Add-on picker. |
| **v4** | Failed | Implementing UTF-16LE encoding and BOM for `template.xml` did not solve recognition issues. |
| **v5** | **CRITICAL** | Discovered the **"Isolation Axiom"**. Malformed add-ons caused permanent, irrecoverable corruption of the target file's layout mode. Safety protocols were established. |
| **v6** | Failed | Even a "bit-perfect" programmatic copy of a working commercial add-on failed to be recognized if the UUID was changed, suggesting hidden index dependencies. |

## 3. Current Project State

### 3.1. Technical Bottlenecks

- **Complexity Floor**: Native add-ons (even minimal ones) require a massive `template.xml` (~4,657 lines in `gcRecordNavigation`). Our 62-line prototype failed.
- **XAR Packaging**: Programmatic XAR creation on Linux requires precise header alignment.
- **Silent Rejection**: FileMaker Pro provides no error logs for add-on recognition failure.
- **Catalog Enumeration**: Missing empty catalogs (e.g., `FieldsForTables` with `membercount="0"`) can trigger failures.

### 3.2. Strategic Pivot: Community Knowledge Search

Based on the repeated failures of "bottom-up" reverse engineering, the project has pivoted to a "top-down" identification of successful community tools.

- **Status**: Research Concluded ([Sophia Research Results](./sophia_research_results_20260205.md)).
- **Key Findings**:
  - **Verdict**: Fully headless generation (no GUI) is **impossible** as the required script step is Pro-client only.
  - **Workaround identified**: A **Hybrid Workflow** using a one-time GUI-generated skeleton can bypass the need for repeated manual intervention.
- **Hypothesis (Revised)**: The "Aesthetic Automation" goal can be achieved by programmatically modifying a natively generated skeleton rather than building from scratch.

## 4. Key Milestones Reached

1. **Isolation Axiom established**: Mandatory "Empty Sandbox" testing protocol.
   - *Definition*: A critical safety protocol requiring all experimental add-on testing to occur only within dedicated, empty "sandbox" FileMaker files to prevent irreversible binary corruption.
2. **38-File Requirement codified**: Standardizing the minimum viable manifest (Icon sets, 12-language JSON/XML set).
3. **Disaster Recovery Protocol**: Step-by-step procedure for rescuing corruption caused by faulty add-ons.

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Synthesize Search Results**: Finalized. Conclusion: FileMaker GUI is a mandatory bottleneck for the *initial* package creation.
2. **Hybrid Workflow Implementation**:
   - Create a minimal "Skeleton Add-on" via FileMaker Pro.
   - Develop Python scripts for UUID/Name/Logic injection into the skeleton's `template.xml`.
3. **Template-Injection Strategy**: Focus on "Template Swapping"—modifying a natively exported base to include Hegemonikón-designed logic.
