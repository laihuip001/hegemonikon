    "title": "Hegemonikón Behavioral Steering Research",
    "summary": "Research and implementation artifacts for using Activation Steering (Steering Vectors) to enforce Cognitive Algebra (CCL) compliance and behavioral alignment in LLMs. Focuses on local execution using consumer-grade GPUs (RTX 2070 SUPER), hardware-specific optimization (VRAM management, 4-bit quantization), and model selection strategies (1.5B vs 7B fallback). Includes specific API implementation details for 'llm-steer' and 'transformers'. This project aims to develop robust, locally executable methods for fine-grained control over LLM behavior, ensuring ethical and aligned outputs while optimizing for resource-constrained environments.",
