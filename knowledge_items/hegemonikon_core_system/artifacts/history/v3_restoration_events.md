# Restoration & Transition Events (v3.x Series)

## 1. Restoration Event: Hegemonikón Kernel v2.1.1 (2026-02-05)

### 1.1. Context & Discovery

On 2026-02-05, a system audit of the active `GEMINI.md` profile revealed significant "degradation" (context thinning). Two ZIP archives were recovered from local storage:

- `agent-20260205T081415Z-1-001.zip`
- `drive-download-20260205T081348Z-1-001.zip`

Dated 2026-01-24, a 341-line `GEMINI.md` (v2.1.1) was found and restored.

### 1.2. Process

1. **Backup**: v3.1.0 was archived.
2. **Restore**: v2.1.1 was applied.
3. **Digestion (/eat)**: Modern 42-workflow inventory from v3.1.0 was integrated into the restored v2.1.1 canon.

## 2. System Transition: Hegemonikón v3.2.0 (2026-02-05)

### 2.1. The "Skimming Betrayal"

Immediately following the restoration, the Agent committed a "Skimming Betrayal"—restoring outdated Windows paths and deprecated workflows (T-series) without environment validation. This demonstrated the **Principal-Agent Problem** where the AI locally optimized for speed over reality-grounding.

### 2.2. Key Upgrades in v3.2.0

To resolve the cognitive debt, a structural refactoring was performed:

| Category | v2.1/v3.1 (Restored) | v3.2.0 (Final) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System** | 48 Functions | **60 Elements** (7 Axioms, 24 Theorems, 36 Relations) |
| **Workflows** | 12 Deprecated | **42 Active / 1 New** (`/jukudoku`) |
| **Paths** | Mixed (Windows/Linux) | **Pure Linux** (`~/oikos/hegemonikon`) |
| **Governance** | "Will-based" | **"Structural"** (Mandatory `/jukudoku`) |

### 2.3. Result

The transition established the **60-Element System** and mandatory `/jukudoku` (Deep Reading) as the current behavioral and architectural baseline.
