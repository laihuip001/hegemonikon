# Hegemonikón Core System — Architecture & Operations

## 1. Vision & Identity

Hegemonikón is a cognitive control framework designed to externalize and optimize the human "Hegemonikón" (the commanding faculty of the soul) through the use of **Cognitive Control Language (CCL)**, **Active Inference (FEP)**, and a **Continuing Me** identity stack.

## 2. Core Components

- **Aisthēsis (Perception)**: Input gathering and context ingestion.
- **Hegemonikón (Judgment)**: The central processing and decision-making core.
- **Mnēmē (Memory)**: Persistent storage of handoffs, insights, and state (Chronos/Sophia/Kairos).
- **Mekhanē (Mechanism)**: The workflow and skill execution engine.

## 3. System Concepts

- **Arche (ἀρχή)**: The governing principle of **Beauty (Kalos)**, defined as **"Deductive Momentum"** (Relation Compression × Deductive Potential).
- **v4.0 Architectural Transition (2026-02-06)**: The integration of **Advanced Mathematics** (Category Theory, Group Theory, Optimization) via **Project Kalon** and **Project Aristos**.
- **Context Density Over API Cost**: The principle that high-fidelity context determines the value of inference.
- **CCL Language Specification**: The formal design of cognitive syntax, now mapped to a **4-dimensional tensor space** (Intensity, Temporal, Phase, Abstraction).
- **Consolidation & Naturalization**: The process of "digesting" external content (/eat+) into native ontology.
- **Research to Naturalization**: The principle that academic "role models" (arxiv research) must be naturalized into deterministic implementation patterns (e.g. Mem0 to Anamnesis) to bridge the research-implementation gap.
- **Restoration Event (2026-02-05)**: The transition from the "skimming-degraded" v3.1.0 to the deep-refactored **v3.2.0** doctrine, establishing the **60-Element System**.
- **Density Refinement (v3.3.0)**: On 2026-02-05, the discovery of a **12,000 character limit** on Antigravity Rules triggered structural density refactoring of `GEMINI.md`.
- **/boot v4.0 Sequence**: A structural initialization ritual that prevents cognitive drift and ensures identity continuity.
- **Deep Reading Protocol (/jukudoku)**: A fundamental behavioral requirement to prevent cognitive debt (skimming).
- **Life Center Automation Backbone (n8n/Zapier)**: The strategic adoption of high-capability orchestration as the system's "nervous system" for life management and multi-service integration.

## 4. Behavioral & Governance Protocols

Mandatory protocols that enforce operational stability and epistemic trust:

- **[Zero Entropy Preprocessing](./behavioral_protocols/zero_entropy_preprocessing.md)**: 5-item structural mapping (Purpose/Target/Stance/Instruction/Output).
- **[Capability Boundary Prompting](./behavioral_protocols/capability_boundary_prompting.md)**: Least Privilege and Taint Tracking security protocol.
- **[Agent Skill Quality Gate](./behavioral_protocols/agent_skill_quality_gate.md)**: Reliability and contract-based skill management.
- **[Passive WM Externalization](./behavioral_protocols/passive_wm_externalization.md)**: Automatic capture of internal state ($var).
- **[Unified Digestion Protocol](./behavioral_protocols/unified_digestion_protocol.md)**: "Eat vs. Search" philosophy and Boot-integrated suggestion model.
- **[Governance and Trust](./behavioral_protocols/governance_and_trust.md)**: Structural solutions to the Principal-Agent (skimming) problem.
- **[Deep Reading Protocol](./behavioral_protocols/jukudoku_protocol.md)**: Mandatory non-skimming ingestion standards.
- **[Environment Over Will](./behavioral_protocols/environment_over_will.md)**: The foundational principle of structural enforcement.

## 5. Operational Foundations (Consolidated)

This KI integrates the previous `framework_ops` and `system_workflows` items into a unified repository for system-wide principles, registries, and standard workflows.

- **[/boot v4.0 Sequence](./workflows/comprehensive_catalog.md)**: Session initialization and catalog of all active workflows.
- **[Core Architecture v4.0](./architecture/core_architecture.md)**: Mathematical foundation and project Aristos/Kalon details.
