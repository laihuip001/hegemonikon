# Project Dendron: Existence Purpose Optimization

Project Dendron is the "Existence Error Minimization" engine of the Hegemonikón framework. It applies the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to the structural existence of code, ensuring that every byte serves a clear, documented purpose.

## Vision v2.1: The Teleological Pivot

Dendron has evolved from simple existence proofs to a rigorous **Existence Purpose Tensor (EPT)**. It distinguishes between the "Reason" (past context) and the "Purpose" (future intent/志向性) of code, prioritizing the latter as the core of existence.

## Core Philosophical Tenets

1. **Purpose > Reason**: Code exists for its future utility, not its past apology.
2. **Regularization = Deduction**: Cleaning code is a mathematical elimination of waste (Existence Error).
3. **FEP Isomorphism**: Dendron is a projection of FEP onto the "existence" coordinate. Existence Error = Existence - Purpose.
4. **Hegemonikón Priority**: Refinement of the core system precedes premature generalization. Generalization is a natural result, not a primary goal.
5. **Normalization ≒ MECE**: Database normalization (NF1-BCNF) is equivalent to achieving MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) structure in cognitive chunks.
6. **Matrix Analysis (Perceived Duality)**: The "Reason vs. Purpose" distinction allows a dual-perspective scan (Past/Source vs. Future/Goal) of any existence.

## The Existence Purpose Tensor (EPT)

Dendron maps the "Purpose" of the codebase across 32 cells in a 3-dimensional tensor:

- **Depth**: L0 (Dir), L1 (File), L2 (Func), L3 (Lexical)
- **Meta-Logic**: Surface, Structure, Function, Verification (Mapped to NF1-BCNF)
- **Temporal Axis**: Purpose vs. Reason
