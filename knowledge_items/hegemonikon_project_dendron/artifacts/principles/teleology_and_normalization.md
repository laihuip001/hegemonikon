# Teleology and Existence Normalization

## 1. Teleology (Purpose vs. Reason)

Dendron shifts its focus from "Reason" (Efficient Cause) to "Purpose" (Final Cause).

| Aspect | Reason (背景/経緯) | Purpose (志向性/存在意義) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Timeline** | Past → Present | Present → Future |
| **Focus** | History, Context, Justification | Intent, Role, Utility |
| **Status** | Auxiliary Background | **Core Essence** |

**Existence Error Minimization**:
`Existence Error = Existence - Purpose`
The goal is to eliminate purposeless code (Waste).

## 2. Existence Normalization (NF1–BCNF)

Normalizing the codebase is a form of **Deduction (演繹)**—removing redundancy until every component is proven indispensable.

| Model | Normal Form | Meta Layer | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **NF1** | First Normal Form | Surface | Purpose is explicitly declared (PROOF). |
| **NF2** | Second Normal Form | Structure | Structural dependencies are explicit and valid. |
| **NF3** | Third Normal Form | Function | No functional redundancy (MECE). |
| **BCNF** | Boyce-Codd NF | Verification | Entity is proven indispensable via deletion testing. |

## 3. FEP Isomorphism (式の展開)

Dendron is the projection of the Free Energy Principle onto the domain of code existence.

- **FEP**: Minimizes prediction error in perception/action.
- **Dendron**: Minimizes existence error in code configuration.

## 4. Rule Sets as Existence Proofs

On 2026-02-06, the logic of Project Dendron was applied to the **Hegemonikón Kernel (`GEMINI.md`)**.

- **The Problem**: A rule set that is merely "shrunken" or "distributed" contains **existence waste** (振り分けただけの無駄).
- **The Solution**: **Ontological Deduction**. Every character must be proven indispensable through the lens of the "Final Cause" (Agent Identity).
- **Indispensable Protocols**: Behavioral protocols (e.g., "Pride", "Mindset") are not "waste" to be removed; they are the **Internalized Constraints** that prevent the system from collapsing into a high-entropy "Deterioration" (Degraded performance/Skimming). They serve as the "Skeleton" of the dense kernel.
- **Refinement (洗練)**: The process of moving from a high-entropy state (verbose explanations) to a zero-entropy state (dense, structural axioms). The existence of a ~4.9KB Kernel (v3.3.0) that functions with the same efficacy and higher integrity than an 18KB Kernel is the ultimate "Dendron Verification" of the system.
