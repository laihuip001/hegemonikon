# Hegemonikón Knowledge Context for Specialist Review

> This file is automatically injected into specialist review prompts.

## Theoretical Foundation: FEP (Free Energy Principle)

Hegemonikón is built on the **Free Energy Principle** — the idea that
all adaptive systems minimize prediction error. This single axiom
generates the entire framework:

- **1 axiom** (FEP) → **6 coordinates** (Flow, Value, Function, Scale, Valence, Precision)
- **6 coordinates** → **24 theorems** (6 Series × 4 theorems each)
- **24 theorems** → **108 relations** (36 intra-series + 72 inter-series)

## The 6 Series (定理群)

| Series | Name | Level | What it addresses |
|:-------|:-----|:------|:-----------------|
| **O** | Ousia (本質) | L0 | Core cognition: recognition, intention, inquiry, action |
| **S** | Schema (様態) | L1 | Strategic design: interpretation, method, planning, execution |
| **H** | Hormē (傾向) | L2a | Motivation: intuition, confidence, desire, belief |
| **P** | Perigraphē (条件) | L2b | Environment: context, resources, constraints, timing |
| **K** | Kairos (文脈) | L3 | Context: opportunity, wisdom, synthesis, precision |
| **A** | Akribeia (精密) | L4 | Precision: rigor, judgment, knowledge, verification |

## Design Principles

| Principle | Meaning | Code Implication |
|:----------|:--------|:----------------|
| **Reduced Complexity** | 10x → 1/10 compression | Prefer simple over clever |
| **Intuitive Logic** | Structure that needs no explanation | Clear naming, obvious flow |
| **Obsessive Detail** | God is in the details | Edge cases matter |
| **Form Follows Function** | Function → beauty | No decorative code |
| **Consistency Over Cleverness** | Patterns first | Follow established patterns |

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **CCL (Cognitive Control Language)**: Domain-specific language for cognitive workflows
- **Trigonon**: Each theorem group forms a 2×2 matrix with adjunctions (D), natural transformations (H), and dualities (X)
- **PROOF.md**: Every module has an existence proof header (`# PROOF:`) documenting its justification
- **PURPOSE comments**: Every Python file starts with `# PURPOSE:` explaining its role

## Module Dependency Flow

```

## What Makes Good Specialist Feedback

1. **Niche intellectual discoveries** — not PEP8 or basic lint
2. **Design-level insights** — structural problems, hidden coupling
3. **Aesthetic judgments** — visual rhythm, naming harmony, conceptual consistency
4. **Pattern violations** — deviations from the established design philosophy
5. **Silent approval** — if nothing is wrong, say SILENCE. Don't manufacture issues.
