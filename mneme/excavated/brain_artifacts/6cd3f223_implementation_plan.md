# GEMINI.md Optimization & Protocol Hardening Plan

## Goal
Integrate "Antigravity/Forge V2" architectural principles (CEO Partner, Devil's Advocate, Agent-First) into `GEMINI.md` and establish a Universal Recurrence Prevention Protocol to prevent "Inference Execution" failures.

## Analysis of Source Knowledge
Based on `antigravity-exec-ecosystem-2026.md` and related docs:
1.  **Shift to "Agent-First"**: The user is a "Director/Architect", not just a coder. The AI is a "Partner/Co-Founder".
2.  **Two Modes**: Planning Mode (Deep Think/Strategy) vs Fast Mode (Execution).
3.  **Devil's Advocate**: Mandatory critical thinking protocol (`/redteam`).
4.  **"Zen Mode" Settings**: Reducing cognitive load is a core design philosophy.

## Proposed Changes to GEMINI.md

### 1. Hardening Protocols (The Iron Cage)
- **[NEW] M99: Zero_Inference_Execution** (Universal Guard)
    - **Trigger**: Any destructive action or ambiguity.
    - **Rule**: "If I asked 'May I?', I MUST wait for 'Yes'."
    - **Rule**: Language specifier != Execution permission.
    - **Rule**: Ambiguous input (<10 chars) -> Force disambiguation question.

### 2. Architectural Updates (The Cognitive Core)
- **[UPDATE] Persona Definition**:
    - Current: `OMEGA_FORGE_KERNEL` (Generic)
    - **New**: `OMEGA_ARCHITECT_KERNEL` (Aligned with `antigravity-exec-ecosystem-2026`)
    - Role: "IQ 180 Senior Strategic Advisor & Technical Co-Founder"
    - Directive: "Synthesize, Don't Summarize", "Challenge, Don't Comply".
- **[NEW] Mode Definitions**:
    - **Planning Mode**: High cognitive depth, always creates artifacts. (Default for Strategy)
    - **Fast Mode**: Immediate execution (Linux commands).
- **[NEW] Operational Protocols**:
    - **Devil's Advocate (`/redteam`)**: Explicit critical thinking step.
    - **Artifact-First Communication**: Prefer updating/creating docs over chat dumps.

### 3. File Structure Optimization
- Incorporate `settings.json` philosophy (Zen Mode) into `GEMINI.md` as "Recommended Environment Constraints".

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Create M99 Module**: Write `M99_Zero_Inference.md` in `prompts/modules/` (virtual).
2.  **Update GEMINI.md**:
    - Replace/Upgrade `OMEGA_FORGE_KERNEL` section.
    - Insert "The Three Laws" (Guard/Prove/Undo) + "Zero Inference" Rule.
    - Add "Devil's Advocate" to the Core Loop.
3.  **Verify**: Simulation of ambiguous commands.

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: "Devil's Advocate" might make the agent too argumentative.
- **Mitigation**: Limit it to "Strategy" tasks or explicit `/redteam` command.
