# Walkthrough - Project Import

I have successfully imported the project files from `G:\その他のパソコン\Forge` to your current workspace.

## Changes

### Imported Files

- **Source**: `G:\その他のパソコン\Forge`
- **Destination**: `c:\Users\raikh\.gemini\antigravity\playground\ruby-cosmos`

The following directories were verified in the source and copied to the destination:

- `.antigravity`
- `.gemini`

## Verification Results

### Directory Listing

Verified that the destination directory contains the expected folders matching the source.

### Investigation of Hidden Data

- **Extensions**: Verified presence of extensions in `.antigravity\extensions`.
- **Chat History**: specific chat history files (`.pb`) were found in `.gemini\antigravity\conversations`.
