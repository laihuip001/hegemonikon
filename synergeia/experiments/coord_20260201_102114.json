      "answer": "A **multi-agent AI framework** is a system where multiple autonomous AI agents work together collaboratively to achieve common goals and solve complex tasks that exceed the capability of any single agent.[1][3]\n\n## Core Components\n\nEach agent in the framework is an **autonomous entity with a specific function or role**.[1] These agents are equipped with decision-making capabilities powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to analyze data, set priorities, and take action based on their environment.[3][4] For example, in a customer service framework, one agent might handle queries, another manages tickets, and another handles escalation.[1]\n\nThe framework relies on several key elements working together:\n\n- **Communication protocols**: Agents communicate model-to-model in natural language for reasoning and coordination, and code-to-code for secure data exchange.[5]\n- **Coordination and planning mechanisms**: These ensure agents align their actions toward a common goal without duplicating efforts, either through centralized oversight or decentralized coordination following shared rules.[1][2]\n- **Orchestration layer**: A central coordinator or agent orchestrator manages workflows while specialized agents collaborate.[6]\n- **Tool and external system integration**: Agents connect with external tools and MCP servers to perform actions and gather data.[2]\n\n## Key Characteristics\n\nMulti-agent systems feature **autonomy, collaboration, and scalability**.[3] Each agent operates independently within its domain while maintaining constant communication and shared situational awareness with other agents.[6] As workflows become more complex, the system scales by adding more specialized agents rather than retraining a single model.[3]\n\nThese frameworks support **real-time decision-making, error handling, and composability**, allowing workflows to be nested or combined to create more complex processes.[1][2] The modular approach provides resilience—if one agent needs updating, others continue operating.[5]",
