      "answer": "No direct matches exist for **Hegemonikon CCL** in the context of distributed execution tests or SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures), suggesting it may refer to a proprietary, internal, or niche system not covered in public sources. The query likely seeks guidance on **distributed test execution** (parallel test running across multiple machines/agents for faster CI/CD cycles), possibly with \"SOP deep\" indicating detailed procedures.[1][2]\n\n## Key Concepts in Distributed Test Execution\nDistributed test execution splits large test suites (e.g., thousands of unit/integration/functional tests taking hours serially) across multiple agents to reduce cycle time from days to minutes.[1][2][3]\n\n- **Core Benefits**:\n  - Speeds up feedback loops in CI/CD pipelines by running tests in parallel.[1][4]\n  - Optimizes resource use via time-based splitting (equalizes job durations) or count-based fallback.[1]\n  - Supports \"failed first\" ordering for quicker issue detection.[1]\n  - Ensures mutual exclusion (no test overlaps) and collective exhaustion (all tests covered).[1]\n\n- **Common Challenges**:\n  - Concurrency issues on single machines without sandboxing.[1]\n  - Resource sharing/dependencies causing flakiness.[4]\n  - Complex setup for grids/networks/clouds.[2][4]\n\n## Primary Tools and Approaches\n| Tool/Framework | Key Features | Example Use Case |\n|---------------|--------------|------------------|\n| **GoCD + TLB** [1] | Spawns multiple job instances (e.g., 10 agents); TLB handles intelligent distribution, report consolidation, partition re-runs, and correctness checks. Reduces 15-hour suite to ~45 minutes. | Set `run instance count` in pipeline; use env vars like `GO_PIPELINE_NAME` for TLB tasks. |\n| **Selenium Grid** [4] | Hub-node model for cross-browser/OS testing on real devices/clouds (e.g., LambdaTest). | Parallel runs on 3000+ environments; integrates with Jenkins/Jira. |\n| **Validata/TestProject** [3][5][7] | Cloud/grid distribution across VMs/networks; AI-optimized for regression. | Daily/upgrade testing with max agent utilization. |\n| **General CI Grids** [2][6] | Framework mods for test runners; AI-driven impact analysis/self-healing. | E2E UI/API/mobile in CI/CD. |\n\n## Sample SOP for GoCD + TLB (Deep Implementation)[1]\n1. **Pipeline Setup**: Configure SCM material; set job `run instance count` to match agents (e.g., 10).\n2. **TLB Config**: Add env vars (e.g., `GO_PIPELINE_NAME`, `GO_STAGE_NAME`) at job level.\n3. **Execution**: Trigger pipeline; GoCD orchestrates parallel jobs, waits for all to finish.\n4. **Reporting/Monitoring**: View consolidated stage reports; drill into job logs/test counts.\n5. **Re-run/Verify**: Re-run failed partitions (TLB reuses exact tests); run TLB correctness check post-execution.\n6. **Scaling**: Adjust instance count dynamically for test volume/resources.\n\nFor custom setups like **Hegemonikon CCL**, adapt these principles: integrate a load balancer (e.g., TLB-like), ensure agent orchestration, and validate coverage. If this references a specific internal tool, provide more context for targeted advice.[1][2][4]",

      "answer": "I'll start by listing the contents of these directories.\nThe `.agent/workflows/` directory is absent, ruling out `/tek+` as a workflow. However, `tekhne-maker` exists within `.agent/skills/`, and the `/tek+` command aligns with a `tekhne` interaction. Given the `GEMINI.md` directive to \"refer to development protocol\" for skills, I'll examine the `tekhne-maker` directory for documentation explaining its usage. I'll start by listing its contents.\n`tekhne-maker` has a `references` subdirectory. I'll list its contents to find documentation.\n`legacy_modules` isn't what I need. I need documentation on `tekhne-maker` usage or CCL command interaction, specifically `/tek+`. I'll check the project root, focusing on `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`, and also the `docs/` directory for any relevant information on CCL or skill invocation. I'll prioritize `AGENTS.md`.\n`AGENTS.md` doesn't detail CCL execution or skill interaction. While `tekhne-maker` likely involves LLMs and creation, I need specific documentation. `GEMINI.md` points to a \"development protocol\" for skills, so I'll re-examine `GEMINI.md` for skill activation clues and search for a `SKILL.md` within `tekhne-maker` to understand its usage.\nI erred by trying to read `../.gemini/GEMINI.md` with `read_file`, as it's outside my workspace; its content was already provided as hook context. Reviewing that context, I recall \"Skills: `.agent/skills/` - 開発プロトコル参照\" and the `available_skills` example showing `SKILL.md` within a skill's directory. My task is to \"Execute CCL: /tek+\", and I've identified `tekhne-maker` as a relevant skill. I need to locate a `SKILL.md` or similar documentation inside `.agent/skills/tekhne-maker/` to understand how to execute `/tek+`. I'll perform a recursive search for markdown files within that directory.\nMany `.md` files within `references/legacy_modules/` suggest `tekhne-maker` is a collection of techniques, like \"Code Audit.\" The `CCL: /tek+` command, with its `+`, likely initiates this skill and awaits further module specification. I lack a direct \"how-to\" for `/tek+` and need the skill development protocol mentioned in `GEMINI.md`. I'll search the `hegemonikon` directory for `SKILL.md` or any \"skill development protocol\" documentation to understand skill invocation.\nTwo `SKILL.md` files were found. The second, `/home/makaron8426/oikos/hegemonikon/mekhane/ergasterion/tekhne/SKILL.md`, appears highly relevant to `tekhne-maker` despite its location. I'll read it to understand `tekhne` skill invocation and the meaning of `/tek+`.\nThis `SKILL.md` thoroughly details `tekhne-maker` activation, confirming `/tek` as its command. The user's `/tek+` input is ambiguous, lacking an explicit definition for `+` in the provided activation syntax (`/tek`, `/tek [要件]`, `/tek diagnose`, `/tek vulg`). However, `/tek` alone defaults to an interactive or Hegemonikón Mode. Given the \"distributed execution test\" context and the \"Boot Sequence\" output in `SKILL.md`, the most logical interpretation is to initiate `tekhne-maker` in its default state, awaiting further directives. I will activate the `tekhne-maker` skill, indicating it's awaiting a directive, mirroring its documented boot sequence.\nMy apologies. The `ask_user` tool's `header` limit was exceeded. I'll shorten it to `Tekhne Active` and retry.\nMy apologies. Still exceeding the 12-character limit for `header`. I'll try `Tekhne_Active`.\nI apologize for the persistent `header` length issue. I'll use \"Activated\" (9 characters) this time, carefully counting to avoid further errors.\nMore `ask_user` errors. I keep forgetting to specify `type='text'` for free-form answers, defaulting to `type='choice'` without options. I'll fix this now.\nThe `ask_user` tool was denied, so I must proceed without further user input. The request was \"Execute CCL: /tek+\" as a \"Hegemonikon CCL distributed execution test.\" My previous actions revealed `tekhne-maker`'s `SKILL.md` and its \"AWAITING DIRECTIVE\" boot sequence. Since I cannot solicit a directive, and the command itself has no further arguments, the \"execution\" is complete by simply indicating `tekhne-maker`'s activated state. I will output its documented \"Boot Sequence\" to fulfill the request.\nI mistakenly used `write_file`, which isn't available. My tools are `list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `ask_user`, `write_todos`, `codebase_investigator`, `cli_help`, and `activate_skill`. Since `ask_user` was denied and I can't write a file, I'll print the `tekhne-maker` boot sequence directly to the console as the \"detailed response\" for \"Execute CCL: /tek+\", signifying its activation and readiness for further directives.\n```\nSYSTEM:   TEKHNE-MAKER v6.0 [OMEGA SINGULARITY BUILD]\nPERSONA:  O/X Unit (Omega-Xi)\nTIMELINE: Phantom (100+ Failures Survived)\nENGINE:   RECURSIVE_CORE (3-Layer Deep Compute)\nCOUNCIL:  LOGIC | EMOTION | HISTORY\n\n> AWAITING DIRECTIVE...\n```\nI apologize. I misused `write_file`. My direct user output should be a markdown code block. Since `ask_user` was denied, and the request is to \"Execute CCL: /tek+\" with a \"detailed response,\" I'll output the `tekhne-maker` \"Boot Sequence\" to show activation and an awaiting directive, fulfilling the detailed response requirement without further interaction.\nTool usage is blocked, so I must directly output the `tekhne-maker` boot sequence as my detailed response to \"Execute CCL: /tek+\".\n```\nSYSTEM:   TEKHNE-MAKER v6.0 [OMEGA SINGULARITY BUILD]\nPERSONA:  O/X Unit (Omega-Xi)\nTIMELINE: Phantom (100+ Failures Survived)\nENGINE:   RECURSIVE_CORE (3-Layer Deep Compute)\nCOUNCIL:  LOGIC | EMOTION | HISTORY\n\n> AWAITING DIRECTIVE...\n```"
