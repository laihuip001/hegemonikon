Dispense **5 μL** at a rate of **225 μL/sec** using Plate Out,In configuration.[1]\n- **Verification**: Weigh the plate after dispensing (target: **5 μL test**). Record the weight and tare the balance for accuracy.[1]\n- **Context**: This is part of the broader **Run a System Test** and **Test the Injection System** protocols, accessible after installing Gen5 software, turning on the reader, establishing communication, and setting dispenser calibration values (if applicable).[1]\n  - Related sections include Injection System Tests (page 59) and Dispense/Read Specifications.[1]\n\n### Full Testing Workflow\n1. Install Gen5 Software and establish communication with the reader.[1]\n2. Set dispenser calibration values if the instrument has an injection system.[1]\n3. Run the **System Test**, incorporating the 5 μL dispense/weigh step.[1]\n4. Advance to specialized tests: Fluorescence (page 54), Luminescence (page 56), or Injection System (page 59).[1]\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The Synergy HTX supports absorbance, fluorescence, luminescence, and dispense/read modes, with pre-installed filters configurable in Gen5.[1]\n- For complete SOP, refer to the full IFU PDF, which includes conformance standards (e.g., EN 61010-1) and warnings for unspecified use.[1]\n- No other search results match \"Synergeia\" (likely a variant spelling) with a 5-thread test; SolarEdge Synergy [2] and unrelated Synergeia contexts [3][4] do not apply.\n\nThis test ensures precise liquid handling for clinical specimen analysis.[1]",

Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of what `/s+` means and what would happen:\n\n## CCL `/s+` Analysis\n\n### Semantic Breakdown\n\n**`/s+`** = **Detailed Strategy** (Σ+ in Greek notation)\n\n- **`/s`** = Strategy (Σ, sigma) - Strategic thinking and planning\n- **`+`** = Detailed/Deep modifier - Increases depth and thoroughness\n\n### Thread Routing\n\nBased on the coordinator configuration at synergeia/coordinator.py:52:\n- `/s` is routed to the **Claude CLI** thread\n- Executor type: `cli`\n- This would create a recursive Claude invocation\n\n### What Would Execute\n\nIf approved, the coordinator would:\n\n1. **Parse the CCL**: Recognizes `/s+` as a single CCL element\n2. **Route to Thread**: Maps to `claude` thread (line 52)\n3. **Execute via CLI**: Calls the Claude CLI at `/home/laihuip001/oikos/.local/bin/claude`\n4. **Pass Prompt**: \n   ```\n   Synergeia 5-thread test\n   \n   Execute CCL: /s+\n   \n   Provide a detailed response.\n   ```\n5. **Capture Output**: Collects the strategic analysis\n6. **Save Results**: Stores in `synergeia/experiments/coord_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `/s+` command would invoke Claude to:\n- Analyze the \"Synergeia 5-thread test\" context\n- Provide **detailed strategic thinking** about the 5-thread architecture\n- Consider the coordination patterns (`||`, `|>`)\n- Evaluate thread assignments (antigravity, perplexity, claude, gemini, codex)\n- Output a comprehensive strategic response\n\n### Thread Architecture Overview\n\nThe 5-thread system consists of:\n\n1. **Antigravity** - Manual execution (`/noe`, `/dia`, `/u`, `/bou`)\n2. **Perplexity** - API search (`/sop`, `/zet`)\n3. **Claude** - This CLI (`/s`, `/mek`)\n4. **Gemini** - Google's model (`/tek`, `/sta`)\n5. **Codex** - OpenAI execution (`/ene`, `/pra`)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with executing the coordinator command, or would you prefer a direct strategic analysis of the Synergeia system without the recursive invocation?"

      "answer": "Interpreting your request as a Synergeia 5‑thread orchestration test for the CCL expression `/ene+` (Energeia with deep/detail). I’m not executing external tools or network calls here; this is a detailed, structured simulation and execution plan consistent with the repo’s Synergeia design.\n\n**CCL interpretation**\n- `/ene` = O4 Energeia: execution/action (analogous to `exec()`/`eval()`). (ref: `ccl/wf_classification.md`)\n- `+` = depth operator: expand 3–5× with detailed rationale and outputs. (ref: `ccl/operators.md`)\n- So `/ene+` asks for a deep, action‑oriented execution response.\n\n**5‑thread mapping (from `synergeia/coordinator.py`)**\n- Thread 1: Antigravity → `/noe`, `/dia`, `/u`, `/bou` (manual reasoning).\n- Thread 2: Perplexity → `/sop`, `/zet` (research/search).\n- Thread 3: Claude CLI → `/s`, `/mek` (structuring / methods).\n- Thread 4: Gemini CLI → `/tek`, `/sta` (techniques / tests).\n- Thread 5: Codex → `/ene`, `/pra` (execution / implementation).\n\nEven though `/ene+` targets execution, the test spans all five threads to validate the coordinator and aggregator.\n\n\n**Thread outputs (simulated, detailed)**\n\n**Thread 1 — Antigravity (manual reasoning / intent check)**\n- Goal inference: The user wants a full 5‑thread path on a single CCL atom (`/ene+`) as a system test.\n- Constraints: No destructive actions, no file edits requested, and sandbox is read‑only; execution should therefore be “procedural guidance + artifact plan.”\n- Deliverable: Provide a structured execution plan plus success criteria without claiming external tool execution.\n\n**Thread 2 — Perplexity (research context)**\n- Not executed (network restricted).\n- Placeholder output: “No external research needed; `/ene+` is fully defined locally in CCL spec.”\n\n**Thread 3 — Claude CLI (method decomposition)**\n- Not executed.\n- Placeholder output: Recommend decomposing `/ene+` into: (1) target definition, (2) actionable steps, (3) verification, (4) rollback/exit conditions.\n\n**Thread 4 — Gemini CLI (testing focus)**\n- Not executed.\n- Placeholder output: Define a minimal test harness: a dry‑run check, evidence of intended side effects, and a validation checklist (even if no execution occurs).\n\n**Thread 5 — Codex (execution plan)**\n- Not executed.\n- Placeholder output: Provide an explicit “execution plan” for /ene+ within this repo context, with steps, expected artifacts, and commands (not run).\n\n\n**Aggregated `/ene+` execution response (detailed)**\n\n**Actionable execution plan**\n1) **Define execution target**  \n   - Scope: A Synergeia 5‑thread test for `/ene+` with no code changes, no external calls.  \n   - Success: A clear, consistent execution narrative that maps `/ene+` onto 5 threads and yields a consolidated output.\n\n2) **Construct orchestration expression (for real runs later)**  \n   Use the distributed operator and explicit thread mapping:\n   ```ccl\n   @thread[antigravity]{/noe+} ||\n   @thread[perplexity]{/sop+} ||\n   @thread[claude]{/s+} ||\n   @thread[gemini]{/sta+} ||\n   @thread[codex]{/ene+}\n   ```\n   - Parallel to stress test concurrency.\n   - Aggregator should merge into a single `/ene+` response.\n\n3) **Define expected artifacts**  \n   - A merged output document with:\n     - Interpretation of `/ene+`.\n     - Thread‑wise contributions.\n     - Final action plan and verification list.\n\n4) **Verification checklist (dry‑run compliant)**\n   - Does each thread align with its supported CCL bases? (Yes: `/ene` → Codex thread)\n   - Is the response expanded in depth? (Yes: detailed plan + validation)\n   - Is there any unclaimed external execution? (No)\n\n5) **Exit criteria**\n   - Provide final consolidated response (this message) that is specific, action‑oriented, and consistent with CCL semantics.\n\n\n**Notes on limitations**\n- No actual CLI or API execution occurred due to sandbox/network restrictions.\n- If you want a real multi‑thread run, I can generate the exact coordinator invocation or a runnable script next.\n\nIf you want me to actually stage a 5‑thread run plan inside the repo (e.g., a test spec file or a `synergeia/experiments` entry), say the word and I’ll draft it (read‑only constraints noted)."
