      "answer": "No established framework named **Cognitive Control Language (CCL)** exists in the search results for distributed execution in multi-agent architectures, particularly for 2025-2026. Related concepts appear in **Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA)** and **Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL)**, which emphasize modular, layered control for AI agents but lack explicit \"CCL\" terminology or distributed multi-agent details.\n\n### Key Related Frameworks from 2025 Sources\n- **Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA)** integrates deliberative reasoning with real-time control using multi-layered loops, modular components (e.g., OntoAgent for belief management and goal reasoning), and conflict resolution via centralized controllers maximizing Nash Social Welfare in distributed cognitive functions.[1]\n- **Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL)** (Kim, 21 Nov 2025) decomposes agent cognition into a five-phase R-CCAM cycle: Retrieval (evidence collection), Cognition (LLM-driven inference), Control (**Soft Symbolic Control** for constraint governance via penalty-modified distributions), Action (validated execution), and Memory (auditable states); designed for single-agent LLM reliability, not explicitly multi-agent or distributed.[1][2]\n- Recent CCA advancements (Liang et al., 7 Dec 2025) use an **Intent Graph** (DAG for tool call constraints) and **Tiered Adjudicator** for intent alignment, achieving near-zero attack success rates in benchmarks; focuses on proactive enforcement in AI agents without distributed multi-agent execution.[1]\n\n### Distributed and Multi-Agent Elements\n- RAN Cognitive Controllers (Banerjee et al., 2020) feature **distributed Cognitive Functions (CFs)** interacting with a centralized controller for resource conflict resolution, but predate 2025-2026.[1]\n- Robotic CCAs like ARMARX (Peller-Konrad et al., 2022) employ **distributed, multi-modal memory subsystems** for sensing, planning, and execution with event-driven updates, supporting real-time operation but not multi-agent coordination.[1]\n- No 2025-2026 results describe CCL-specific distributed execution across multiple agents; future directions suggest convergence of symbolic/neural components for modular, adaptive control in open environments.[1]\n\nThese architectures prioritize explainability, constraint enforcement, and goal alignment over distributed multi-agent paradigms. If CCL refers to a specific unpublished or niche project, search results provide no supporting evidence.",
